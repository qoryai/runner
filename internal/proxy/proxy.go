// Package proxy is the HTTP proxy the session is started behind.
//
// The proxy listens on a loopback port, or on the address a wall asks for, and the
// session's environment names it in the proxy variables, upper and lower case, with
// loopback in NO_PROXY so a local server still answers. Every connection through it is
// one [Decision] handed to an observer: a CONNECT tunnel, decided on its authority, or a
// plain request, decided on the authority of its absolute-form target. A host a deny
// entry matches is denied with 403 in either mode, and nothing is opened for it; past
// that, in observe mode every decision allows, and in enforce mode a host no allow
// entry matches is denied the same way. The session continues either way. A decision
// says what became of the connection as its outcome: dialled, or not dialled because
// it was refused, or dialled and failed.
//
// The policy the proxy decides by is the one it was started with until [Proxy.SetPolicy]
// replaces it: a run whose server sends a new run configuration reloads it this way,
// for new connections at once, and a tunnel open to a host the new policy denies is
// closed and recorded as refused.
//
// A proxy that serves an enclosure is guarded ([Proxy.Guard]): it dials from this
// machine on behalf of something that is not on it, so what is on this machine is not
// reached by default. The link-local range, which holds a cloud's metadata service, is
// refused whatever the policy says. This machine's own addresses, loopback and every
// address an interface holds, are refused unless an allow entry names the host itself,
// not a *. suffix over it: a local MCP server or model endpoint is reached through the
// proxy like everything else, decided and recorded, when the policy names it, in either
// mode. Without the guard the way around a wall is through the proxy.
//
// Behind a wall, for the hosts [Proxy.Terminate] is given, the proxy ends the session's
// TLS itself, reads each request's path and sets a credential on it, or hands it to the
// tool that serves the host. For every other
// host the proxy sees host names and ports and never the content of a TLS connection: a
// tunnel is a blind relay once established. Only a proxy-aware program is seen.
