// Package runtimes is the boundary between the runner and the program it runs: an agent
// runtime such as Claude Code, Codex or one of a caller's own. The runner starts a
// process, records it and stops it; what is particular to a program, how it is made to
// report, what its records mean and how it is asked to leave, is behind [Runtime].
//
// There are three ways to a Runtime. [Bare] is a program the runner knows nothing
// about: the run is recorded, the session inside it is not. [Described] is a runtime
// written as data, a descriptor of the contract that matches records and copies fields
// and names an [Installer] among the ones it is given; nothing of a descriptor runs.
// And a caller that embeds the runner implements the interface itself. The catalog
// package resolves a name to the first two.
