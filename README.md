# Qory runner

The security boundary around one coding agent session. The runner starts the agent on a
composed harness, pins a policy that can only narrow what the binary allows, observes and
enforces egress through a proxy it owns, keeps the runner's credentials out of the
session, heartbeats while the session runs, and reports the session's output and its own
observations as CloudEvents: to files always, to a server when one is configured.
Optionally it starts the agent behind a wall, a container with no route out except to
that proxy, so a program that ignores the proxy reaches nothing.

This is a Go module, `github.com/qoryai/runner`, imported by the [`qory`](https://github.com/qoryai/qory)
command, which ships `qory run` in front of it. It has no command of
its own.

## Using it

**From the command.** Install [`qory`](https://github.com/qoryai/qory), compose a harness,
and run the runtime through it instead of starting it yourself:

```sh
qory harness compose
qory run                                # the composed runtime, at your terminal
qory run claude -- -p "Reply pong"      # one headless turn
```

Every connection the runtime makes goes through the runner's proxy and is recorded; the
session is written to `.qory/runs/<id>/` in the checkout as `events.jsonl`, one
CloudEvent per line, beside `output.log`, the session's bytes. One optional file,
`~/.config/qory/runner.yaml`, never in a repository, changes what the runner does.
`egress` is the ceiling on what the runtime may reach; without it everything is allowed
and recorded. `server` names the server the runner reports to, signed, and takes the
run's policy from when the server offers one; with it configured the runner does not
start unless the server answers, and `qory run --local` runs with the files alone:

```yaml
apiVersion: qory.dev/v1alpha1
egress:
  mode: enforce                         # or observe: record everything, deny only what deny names
  allow: [api.anthropic.com, "*.github.com"]
  deny: [gist.github.com]               # denied in either mode, whatever allow says
server:                                 # optional
  url: https://qory.example
  access_key: ak_f1xt0re000000000
  secret: sixteen-characters-at-least   # or QORY_SERVER_SECRET in the environment
```

A denied connection is one `403` to the runtime and one `ai.qory.run.egress` event with
`decision: denied`; the session goes on. Nothing the runner does ends a session.

The proxy sees only programs that honour it. A `wall` section, or
`qory run --wall docker --image <image>`, starts the runtime in a container with no
route out except to the proxy, so the rest fails instead of going unseen:

```yaml
wall:
  adapter: docker
  image: example.com/agent:1            # yours: the runtime and your toolchain
  env: [ANTHROPIC_API_KEY]              # names; nothing else of your environment goes in
```

**From Go.** The module is a library with one entry point. A caller builds a
[`session.Spec`](session/session.go), the program to start and how, and gets a
[`session.Result`](session/session.go) back when the runtime has exited and the sinks
are flushed:

```go
rt, err := catalog.Lookup("claude", "")           // a runtime by its name, see below
res, err := session.Run(ctx, session.Spec{
	Runtime:   rt,
	Command:   "claude",
	Args:      []string{"--settings", settings, "-p", "Reply pong."},
	Policy:    &session.Policy{Version: 1, Egress: session.PolicyEgress{Mode: "enforce", Allow: hosts}},
	Server:    nil,                               // files only; a *session.Server reports as well
	Forwarder: []string{exe, "forward"},          // the hook command, see below
})
if err != nil {                                   // the run did not start
	return err
}
os.Exit(res.ExitCode)                             // the runtime's status; res.Dir is the record
```

`Runtime` is the program as the runner needs to know it, a
[`runtimes.Runtime`](runtimes/runtimes.go): how its launch is prepared, what its records
mean, how it is asked to leave. `catalog.Lookup(name, dir)` resolves a name: a
descriptor `<name>.yaml` in `dir`, which is how a machine describes a runtime nothing
ships for, then the contract's own, Claude Code's today, and for a name with neither a
bare runtime, run and recorded with no session events. A program that needs code of its
own implements the interface, and `runtimes/runtimetest` holds it to the same checks.

The spec's `Declared` is the egress the harness declared, reported in the record as
`harness_hosts` and deciding nothing; nil means no declaration. `Interactive` runs the
session on a pseudo-terminal, unless an argument the runtime's descriptor names as
headless is among `Args`, `-p` for Claude Code; else it runs on pipes, where the
runtime's structured output is read. The command named in `Forwarder`
is installed as the runtime's hook and must call `session.Forward(ctx, os.Stdin)`, which
hands the hook's input to the run over a socket named in the environment. The whole
sequence, every event type and every file is in the
[contract](contracts/runner/v1/README.md); [`session/example_test.go`](session/example_test.go)
is the example above, compiled with the tests.

**Behind a wall.** Without one, enforcement is cooperative: a program that ignores the
proxy variables is not seen. A [`wall.Wall`](wall/wall.go) in the spec starts the runtime
in an enclosure whose only route out leads to the proxy; the session runner, the policy
and the server's secret stay outside, and the run's record is read-only inside. The
Docker adapter uses the `docker` command and whatever engine it reaches:

```go
res, err := session.Run(ctx, session.Spec{
	Runtime: rt,
	Command: "claude",                            // a path inside the image
	Args:    []string{"-p", "Reply pong."},
	Env:     []string{"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=" + key}, // under a wall, nothing else goes in
	Dir:     checkout,                            // the workspace, mounted at its own path
	Mounts:  []wall.Mount{{Path: home, ReadOnly: true}}, // what else of this machine it sees
	Image:   "example.com/agent:1",               // yours: the runtime and the toolchain
	Limits:  wall.Limits{Memory: "8g", ShmSize: "2g"},  // what the agent may use; zero is the engine's default
	Timeout: 5 * time.Hour,                       // the runtime is stopped at it; run.exited says so
	Labels:  map[string]string{"issue": "77"},    // the caller's names for the run, in run.started and the run configuration request
	Wall: &wall.Docker{
		Helper:    linuxBuild,                    // a static Linux build of this program
		RelayArgs: []string{"relay"},             // the mode of it that calls wall.Relay
	},
	Forwarder: []string{wall.HelperPath, "forward"},
	Events:    os.Stdout,                         // every event as a JSON line, as well
})
```

The helper is the caller's own binary, built static for Linux and mounted read-only into
the enclosure, where it runs as the relay the agent reaches the proxy through and as the
hook forwarder; the wall needs no image of its own. What every wall guarantees, what
crosses it and its limits are the contract's [wall section](contracts/runner/v1/README.md#the-wall),
and the [`wall/walltest`](wall/walltest/walltest.go) suite checks the list from inside
the enclosure. `Events` is any stream: a run with no receiver is followed on standard
output with the lines `events.jsonl` holds.

**Being the server.** A `session.Server` names a server the runner is a client of:
it fetches the server's configuration document with a signed `GET` of
`/.well-known/qory-configuration`, posts every event where that says, signed and with
the access key beside the signature, and when the document names a run configuration,
fetches that with every label of the run as its query and takes its `security_policy`
as the run's policy: which labels name what the run works on is the server's to
decide. A server that
answers a later batch with another digest has the runner fetch the run configuration
again and put it in force while the run goes. A server is a control plane, or a
receiver of your own: the contract's [server section](contracts/runner/v1/README.md#the-server)
has the rules, the public package [`receiver`](receiver/receiver.go) is a worked
example, and `contracts/runner/v1/fixtures/signed/` is what any receiver is tested
against.

## The node runner

A node runner is a machine that runs agents for someone else: it takes work, starts each
run behind a wall, and reports what happened. It is two halves, and one of them ships.

| Half | What it does | State |
|---|---|---|
| **The wall** | starts the agent in a container with no route out except to the session runner's proxy; the policy, the record and the server's secret stay on the node | ships since 0.2.0, as `qory run --wall docker`; since 0.3.0 it holds a run's credentials outside the container and holds a host to paths |
| **The fleet layer** | registers the node with a control plane, heartbeats and claims work | not built; no command starts it, and nothing here describes it as if one did. The run's policy from the control plane ships since 0.4.0, as the server's run configuration |

So today a node is a machine with Docker on which `qory run --wall docker` is started,
by a person, a CI job or a scheduler of your own. Reporting to a control plane already
works without the fleet layer, because it is the same server every run has: the control
plane creates the run from the first event it sees, and hands the run its policy.

### How it works

```
 the node                                              elsewhere
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ qory run: the session runner, outside the wall      │
│   policy ─▶ proxy ─▶ decides, records, dials ───────┼──▶ the hosts the policy allows
│   events ─▶ .qory/runs/<id>/events.jsonl            │
│          └▶ events, signed ─────────────────────────┼──▶ the server: your control plane
│      ▲ proxy      ▲ hooks       ▲ terminal          │
│══════╪════════════╪═════════════╪════ the wall ═════│
│  ┌───┴───┐   ┌────┴─────────────┴────────────────┐  │
│  │ relay │◀──│ the agent's container: your image │  │
│  └───────┘   │ no route · no resolver · not root │  │
│              └───────────────────────────────────┘  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The agent's container is on a network with no route out. The one peer it reaches is the
relay, which copies a fixed port to the proxy and decides nothing. Every connection is
therefore the proxy's to decide and record, and a program that ignores the proxy reaches
nothing. The checkout and the composed home are mounted at their own paths, the run's
record read-only; nothing else of the node is visible inside. What every wall guarantees
is the contract's [wall section](contracts/runner/v1/README.md#the-wall), and the
[conformance suite](wall/walltest/walltest.go) checks it from inside the container in
this repository's CI.

### Starting it

You need the `docker` command with an engine behind it, [`qory`](https://github.com/qoryai/qory)
0.7.0 or later, and an image of yours that holds the runtime and your toolchain; the
wall builds none. A minimal one for Claude Code:

```dockerfile
FROM node:22-slim
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git ca-certificates \
 && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* && npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
# The container runs as the node's user, who has no home in the image.
ENV HOME=/tmp
```

```sh
docker build -t agent:1 .
cd your-checkout && qory harness compose
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...            # a key, or CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN from `claude setup-token`
qory run --wall docker --image agent:1 --env ANTHROPIC_API_KEY claude -- -p "Reply pong"
```

The run is recorded in `.qory/runs/<id>/` as without a wall, `ai.qory.run.started` names
the wall and the image, and the exit status is the agent's. Two things differ by machine:

- **On Linux** `qory` mounts itself into the container as the relay and the hook
  forwarder, and the agent's hooks reach the runner.
- **On a Mac** the container cannot run the Mac's binary: download the Linux archive of
  the same `qory` release for your engine's architecture and name the binary as
  `wall.helper`. The hook socket does not cross the engine's virtual machine, so a walled
  run there has the log, the egress record and the structured output, and no hook events.

### Configuring it

One file on the node, `~/.config/qory/runner.yaml`, never in a repository, so a checkout
cannot set what it runs under. With it, a bare `qory run` is walled:

```yaml
apiVersion: qory.dev/v1alpha1
egress:                         # what the agent may reach; without it, everything, recorded
  mode: enforce                 # or observe: record everything, deny only what deny names
  allow: [api.anthropic.com, github.com, "*.githubusercontent.com"]
server:                         # how the node reports; without it, files only
  url: https://control-plane.example.com
  access_key: ak_f1xt0re000000000
  secret: sixteen-characters-at-least   # or QORY_SERVER_SECRET in the environment
wall:
  adapter: docker
  image: agent:1                # or --image
  env: [ANTHROPIC_API_KEY]      # names; the values come from qory run's environment
  user: "1000:1000"             # only where qory runs as root, which a wall refuses
  helper: /opt/qory/qory-linux  # only where qory is not a Linux build
  command: podman               # only for another command than docker
```

- **`egress`** is the policy when the server offers no run configuration. Hosts only:
  a name, or `*.` and a name for every host below it. The hosts the harness's modules
  declare are reported and decide nothing; the list decides.
- **Behind a wall the proxy is guarded.** It never dials link-local addresses, the cloud
  metadata service among them, and it dials the node itself only for a host this list
  names, not for one under a `*.` entry. A model endpoint or MCP server on the node is
  reached through the proxy by the node's host name, listed here; `localhost` inside the
  container is the container.
- **`server`** names the control plane: the runner fetches its configuration document,
  posts every event where that says, signed, and takes the run's policy from its run
  configuration when it offers one. With it set the run does not start unless the
  server answers the fetch and a ping, so a run meant to be observed is not run
  unobserved; `--local` runs with the files alone.
- **`wall.env`** is the whole of the node's environment that goes in, by name. The model
  credential is among it and is then the agent's; keeping it outside, injected by the
  proxy, is not built.
- `--wall none` runs once without the wall, `--wall docker --image ...` once with one on
  a node that has no `wall` section.

### What is not there yet

- The fleet layer: register, heartbeat, claim.
- Hook events on an engine inside a virtual machine, until the forwarder has a network
  transport through the relay.
- Git inside the container when the checkout is a git worktree, whose repository data
  lies outside the mounts, unless the run lists that directory among them.

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `contracts/runner/v1/` | the contract: the documents, a JSON schema each, the runtime descriptors and the fixtures. [Its README](contracts/runner/v1/README.md) is the specification |
| `contracts/` | the Go package that embeds the contract and validates every fixture |
| `session/` | the session runner: `session.Run` takes a launch spec, with the policy, the server and the wall as values, and returns the exit status; `session.Forward` is the hook forwarder behind it |
| `runtimes/` | the runtime: `runtimes.Runtime`, the interface between the runner and the program it runs, how a launch is prepared, what the program's records mean, how it is asked to leave. `Described` is a runtime written as a descriptor, `Bare` a program the runner runs and does not read, `runtimes/claude` Claude Code, `runtimes/catalog` a name resolved to one, and `runtimes/runtimetest` the conformance suite every runtime passes |
| `wall/` | the wall: the adapter interface, the Docker adapter, and `wall.Relay`, the one peer an enclosure reaches. `wall/walltest` is the conformance suite every adapter passes before it ships |
| `receiver/` | a server of the contract that is not a control plane: the handler the tests run the runner against, tested against the signed fixtures, a worked example of the contract's receiving rules |
| `internal/` | what the layers share: `policy`, `proxy`, `event`, `sink`, `server`, `descriptor`, `socket`, `chunk` |
| `node/` | the node runner's fleet layer, not built yet: it will register, heartbeat, take a dispatched task, hold the run's credentials and start a session through `session`, behind a wall ([§The node runner](#the-node-runner)) |

`qory run` calls `session.Run` with the spec it builds from the composed home and the
launch template, and `session.Forward` from the hook command it installs.

## Two invariants

`qory` imports `runner`; `runner` imports nothing of `qory`. The runner knows nothing of
stacks, modules, homes or reports; it takes a spec. Inside the module, `node` imports
`session` and `session` never imports `node`; `session` imports `wall` for the
interface, and only `wall/walltest` imports `session`.

A policy, a server document and a descriptor select among what the binary does.
They never add to it. New behaviour arrives only in a release.
