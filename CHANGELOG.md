# Changelog

Every release of the runner, newest first, in the shape of [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
The version numbers follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html); before 1.0 a minor
release may change what an existing document does, and says so under Upgrading.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `session.Spec.Timeout`: a time limit for the runtime. At the limit it is stopped as
  the context ending stops it, `ai.qory.run.exited` carries `reason: timeout`, and
  `Result.TimedOut` is set. `Spec.StopGrace` is the time between SIGTERM and SIGKILL
  whenever the runner stops the runtime, ten seconds unless named.
- `session.Spec.Labels`: the caller's own names for the run, reported as `labels` in
  `ai.qory.run.started` and nowhere else. At most 16, keys of `a-z`, `0-9`, `_`, `.`
  and `-`, values of at most 256 bytes.
- `session.Spec.Limits` and `wall.Limits`: processors, memory, processes and the size
  of `/dev/shm` for the agent's container, as `--cpus`, `--memory`, `--pids-limit` and
  `--shm-size` with the Docker adapter. The relay gets none.
- `session.ReadPolicy` and `Policy.Under`: a command reads a run's own policy file and
  puts it under the machine's, which it can only narrow.

- `session.Resend`: completes and delivers the record of a run that is over, for a
  job's last step after a runner that died or a receiver that was away. The run
  directory gains `delivered.log`, a line per accepted batch written as the answer
  comes, and `lock`, held while the runner lives; a run that still goes is
  `ErrRunning`. A record with no `ai.qory.run.exited` gets one with `reason:
  runner_lost`, and the events no accepted batch named are posted in order.
- `wall.Reaper`, and `Docker.Reap`: removes the containers and networks that carry a
  run's label, what a runner that died left behind. `Resend` asks for it.

### Changed

- A `Spec.RunID` that is not a UUID in the canonical lower-case form is refused. It
  went unchecked into the run directory's path and into the events' `subject`, which
  the envelope's schema holds to a UUID.
- The Docker adapter refuses a mount that is a socket, or a directory holding a
  container runtime's socket.

### Fixed

- The contract's event table listed `path` in `ai.qory.run.policy_applied`, which no
  schema and no runner has had since the policy became a value, and said every session
  event may carry `agent_id`, which `ai.qory.session.result` cannot.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-17

### Added

- The wall, `wall.Wall`: an optional enclosure for the runtime whose only route out
  leads to the session runner's proxy, so a program that ignores the proxy variables
  reaches nothing instead of going unseen. The session runner stays outside with the
  policy and the webhook's secret, and the enclosure sees the run directory read-only. `session.Spec` gains `Wall`, `Image` and `Mounts`;
  under a wall a nil `Env` is nothing, not the process's own, and
  `ai.qory.run.started` carries `wall` and `image`.
- The Docker adapter, `wall.Docker`, through the `docker` command and no library: an
  `--internal` network for the agent whose bridge holds no address of the host's, a relay container on that network and an ordinary
  one, both containers as the caller's user with every capability dropped and no new
  privileges, the workspace at its own path, the runner's settings read-only, the
  environment through a file so no value is on a command line, and everything removed at
  exit. The proxy binds the network's gateway on a Linux host and stays on loopback where
  the engine is in a virtual machine.
- The guard: behind a wall, or with `ProxyBind` set, the proxy refuses the link-local
  range always, and the runner's own machine, loopback and every address it holds,
  unless an allow entry names the host itself, in either mode. The way around the wall
  is not through the proxy, and a local MCP server or model endpoint is reached through
  it when the policy names it. A refused literal address or `localhost` is a denied
  `ai.qory.run.egress` with the rule `wall:own-address`; a name that resolves to one is
  refused when dialled.
- `wall.Relay`, the one peer an enclosure reaches: it copies a fixed port to one address
  fixed when it starts. The caller's binary runs it in a mode of its own and is mounted
  into the enclosure as the relay and the hook forwarder, so the wall needs no image.
- The conformance suite, `wall/walltest`: the contract's guarantees checked from inside
  the enclosure with a real session behind the adapter. CI runs it against Docker on a
  Linux machine, where a skip is a failure; golden files pin the adapter's command lines
  everywhere else.
- `session.Spec.ProxyBind`, the address the proxy listens on, for a caller that builds
  an enclosure of its own; loopback stays the default.
- `session.Spec.Events`, a stream that gets every event as the JSON line `events.jsonl`
  holds: a run with no receiver is followed on standard output.
- The contract gains §The wall: the guarantees, what crosses, the relay, the suite and
  what ships; and under §Limits the three outcomes of a connection, the model credential
  inside the enclosure, the proxy's address on a Linux host, and hooks on an engine in a
  virtual machine.
- `QORY_RUN_SOCKET` is read as an address: a path, or `unix:` and a path, is the local
  socket, and another scheme is a transport the forwarder refuses by name, so a network
  transport can be added without an old forwarder misreading it.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- The runner contract, `contracts/runner/v1/`: the policy document, the webhook
  configuration, the event types with a JSON schema per data type, the batch and
  signature rules, the runtime descriptor schema, and the Claude Code descriptor with its
  fixtures. The `contracts` package embeds the directory and its tests validate every
  fixture against the schemas.
- The session runner, `session.Run`: the policy, given by the caller as a value and
  validated against the schema, pinned with the digest of its canonical JSON, or observe
  with none; the webhook configuration given the same way; the loopback proxy in observe and enforce modes, one `run.egress` event per
  connection and a 403 for a denied one; the session on a pseudo-terminal when
  interactive and on pipes otherwise, its output chunked into `run.log`; the runtime's
  descriptor mapping its JSON lines and its hook calls to session events; the hook
  forwarder installed into the settings the launch passes, reporting over a local
  socket; a heartbeat; `run.exited` as the result; `events.jsonl` and `output.log`
  under `.qory/runs/<id>/`.
- The webhook sink: a ping the receiver must accept before the run starts when a
  webhook is configured, and none when it is not; signed batches with a delivery id;
  retries with backoff; 410 as stop; what is not accepted spooled under `undelivered/`
  and counted at exit.
- `internal/receiver`, the receiving side the tests run the webhook sink against: a
  handler that verifies the signature in constant time, deduplicates on event id and
  appends to a file that remembers its ids across restarts.
- The contract states that no declaration and an empty declaration differ: no list
  leaves the policy's allow list as it is, an empty list under enforce reaches nothing.
  It names the policy's `egress.allow` grammar as the one definition of a declared host,
  which the harness contract copies.
