# Changelog

Every release of Forager, newest first, in the shape of [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
The version numbers follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html); before 1.0 a minor
release may change what an existing document does, and says so under Upgrading.

## [Unreleased]

### Core and contract

#### Upgrading

- `link.Local.Files` is a list of `link.File`, each path with what it is, the phrase a
  refused mount names it by.
- `policy.Covers` covers an IP literal by an identical entry alone, as `policy.Match`
  matches it: `*.0.0.1` covers no `10.0.0.1`, under a machine's ceiling as in
  narrowing.
- `session.Policy`'s `Tools` and `Credentials`, and the policy package's, distinguish an
  empty list from none: an empty list is written as `[]`, and as a node's policy beside
  a server's it allows none of the server's tools or credentials.
- `dev.qory.run.started` requires `opened_by` and `credential`, and
  `dev.qory.run.exited` no longer requires `exit_code`. A receiver reads `opened_by` to
  tell a session's run from one a gateway opened, which contains no `exit_code`, and
  `credential` to tell a run whose run credential the run's starter gave, `starter`,
  from one on a gateway's local link, `none`.
- `dev.qory.run.exited`'s `state` is required on every `dev.qory.run.exited`, a run a
  gateway opened's too, and has `cancelled` beside `succeeded` and `failed`: the run was
  stopped before it said how it went. A run stopped at its time limit, `timeout`, is
  `cancelled`, and so is `session.Result.State`; so is a session's run stopped from
  where it was started, `interrupted`, a Ctrl-C or a signal to the program that runs
  the session, with the runtime's own `exit_code` and `signal`; such a run was recorded
  `failed`, or not at all when the runtime exited 0 at the stop. Its `reason` is an
  open code, `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]{0,63}$`, with no list: Forager's own codes, or the run's
  starter's, carried as given. A receiver reads the state from `state`, and shows a
  reason it does not know as it is.
- `server.Ended` returns a `server.RunEnd`, the code, who ended the run, and the state
  and the reason of that end, in place of the code alone, and `sink.Config.OnEnded`
  takes a `server.RunEnd` in place of the code and who ended it.
- A run registers with the server with one signed `POST` to the discovery's `run.url`,
  in place of the ping and the run configuration `GET` with the labels as its query.
  The body, `run-registration.schema.json`, holds the run's id, its labels, what it is
  about, `forager_version`, `contract_version`, `interval_seconds`, `events` and
  `time`. The labels no longer travel in a URL, and what a run is about never selects a
  policy. The answer is the run's run configuration, a signed `200` with
  `X-Qory-Run-Configuration`. A reload fetches it again by the run's id, a signed
  `GET <run.url>/<run_id>`. A `time` more than 300 seconds from the server's clock is
  an unsigned `401`. A registration the server accepted with the same bytes under the
  same access key gets the same answer again; one whose run id it accepted with other
  bytes, or under another access key, is a `409` `run_id_used`.
- Discovery's `run` is required, and `run.url` has no trailing slash, query or
  fragment; a document without `run` is refused. A server serves the run endpoint even
  with no policy, and answers every registration `{"version":1}`.
- `dev.qory.ping` is gone, with `events/ping.schema.json`, and nothing is posted in its
  place. Once the server accepts the registration, the gateway writes
  `dev.qory.run.registered` as line 1 of its record, with these members, each required:
  `workspace`, the one workspace discovery lists; discovery's `node_id`; `instance_id`,
  the instance id the registration was signed with, as its `X-Qory-Instance-Id` carried
  it; and the registration's `forager_version`, `events`, `contract_version` and
  `interval_seconds`. It is the record's alone and never posted.
  `event.RunRegistered` names it. The gateway's `delivered.log` begins
  `registered <seq>`. Heartbeats run from the accepted registration until the final
  event.
- A server's `409` to the registration reads `register <run.url>: <code> (status 409)`,
  such as `register https://apiary.example/v1/runs: instance_limit (status 409)`, in
  place of `ping <events URL>: …`. `server.ErrNotAccepted` reads "the server did not
  accept the run", and a signed `410` to the registration "register <run.url>: status
  410: the server did not accept the run". `gateway.ResendNotOpened` reads "the run never
  opened at the server; nothing is sent", reported only by a resend to a server.
- `receiver.Handler` serves the run endpoint at `receiver.DefaultRunPath`, `/v1/runs`
  in place of `/v1/run-configuration`: a run's registration, and its reload by id. Its
  `RunConfiguration` hook is
  `func(run receiver.Run) (document []byte, digest string, refusal *receiver.Refusal)`:
  a `receiver.Run` holds the access key id, the instance id, the run id, the labels and
  `about`, and a `*receiver.Refusal` is a signed answer of its `Status`, with its `Code`
  or no body. Without a hook every run gets `receiver.NoPolicy`, `{"version":1}`.
  `Admit` is asked at the registration. The handler answers a reload only for a run the
  same access key registered, and `404` otherwise.

#### Added

- `event.OpenedBySession` and `event.OpenedByGateway`, the values of `opened_by`,
  `event.CredentialStarter` and `event.CredentialNone`, the values of `credential`, and
  `event.ReasonTimeout`, `ReasonInterrupted`, `ReasonRunClosed`, `ReasonGatewayLost`,
  `ReasonSessionLost`, `ReasonQuiet`, `ReasonCredentialExpired`, `ReasonStopped`,
  `ReasonBatchRefused`, `ReasonCredentialCheckUnreachable` and
  `ReasonCredentialCheckInvalid`, Forager's own reasons of `dev.qory.run.exited`;
  `interrupted` ends a session's run stopped from where it was started, `cancelled`;
  `stopped` ends a run whose starter no longer holds
  its run credential active and gave no outcome; `batch_refused` is the gateway's `410`
  to a session whose batch it refused, the reason of the gateway's own
  `dev.qory.run.exited`, `failed`, and the reason the session records in its own
  record after it; `credential_check_unreachable` and `credential_check_invalid` end a
  run whose run credential could not be checked, the introspection endpoint unreachable
  after the gateway's tries or its answer not valid, and are also the codes of the
  gateway's `503` and `502` to a run request for the same. The session's `dev.qory.run.started` contains
  `opened_by` `session`, and the `credential` of the gateway's run answer.
  `event.StateSucceeded`, `StateFailed` and `StateCancelled` are the states of
  `dev.qory.run.exited`, and `event.IsState` says whether a string is one;
  `event.Reserved` says whether a reason is one of Forager's reserved codes, the old
  names among them, and `event.StarterReason` whether it may be a starter's: a code of
  the pattern of `reason` that is not reserved.
- Contract `v1` revision 1, amended in place, lets the run's starter say how a run
  ended, and carries it to the end of the run. The starter's introspection endpoint
  may add `qory_outcome`, `succeeded`, `failed` or `cancelled`, and `qory_reason`, a
  code, to an answer of `active: false`: service-specific members of its own as RFC 7662 §2.2
  allows, not registered under §3.1 and so prefixed `qory_`, with one documented
  deviation, the SHOULD NOT of §2.2 and §4 about saying why a credential is inactive. The outcome applies to every live run of that run key; with
  no outcome the run ends `cancelled` with `stopped`, with no reason its reason is
  empty, and a reason that is one of Forager's reserved codes, or no code, is dropped;
  a `qory_outcome` other than the three is ignored and counts as no outcome, and
  neither bad member makes the answer invalid: `active` decides as before. Forager's
  codes are reserved: `timeout`, `interrupted`, `quiet`, `credential_expired`,
  `stopped`, `session_lost`, `gateway_lost`, `batch_refused`, `credential_check_unreachable`,
  `credential_check_invalid` and `run_closed`, and the old names `run_ended_at_issuer`,
  `issuer_unreachable` and `issuer_answer_invalid`, which are never written. A `410`
  that ends a run on the link carries the `state` and the `reason` of that end, new
  optional members of `link-refusal.schema.json`. Behind a separate gateway, a session
  whose runtime exits by itself asks once, `GET <run.url>/<run_id>/outcome` with what a
  reload carries; the gateway asks the starter at most once per run and answers within
  about 6 seconds with a `link-outcome-answer.schema.json` document, `{}` or the
  starter's `state` and `reason`, which the session's `dev.qory.run.exited` then
  carries beside the runtime's own `exit_code`. The gateway holds that event to the
  answer, and with no outcome to the runtime's exit: `succeeded` with exit status 0,
  `failed` otherwise, or `cancelled` with `timeout` or with `interrupted`, whatever the
  exit status or the signal. An answer that the run credential
  is no longer active holds the run key, and the run that asked may still end with its
  own exit for up to 30 seconds; when they pass, the gateway ends it itself as the
  starter said, never `session_lost`, and within them the answer wins over the run
  credential's `exp`. `link-outcome-answer.schema.json` refuses a `reason` that is one
  of Forager's reserved codes. On the local link it is never asked, and is `400`
  `invalid_request`. The README's §The events, How a run
  ends, gives the state of each of Forager's own endings, and §Run credentials and
  `docs/gateway-run-credentials.md` the starter's two members. `fixtures/` has a run
  a gateway opened that its starter ended with an outcome and a reason, a session's
  run that ends `cancelled` with `stopped`, two session batches whose `dev.qory.run.exited`
  is `cancelled` with `interrupted`, one with the runtime's exit status and one with its
  signal, one whose starter
  gave its outcome at the exit, the outcome answers, `410`s with a `state` and a `reason`, and refused ones: a
  `dev.qory.run.exited` without `state`, with a state of no kind it names, with a
  reason that is no code or `gateway_lost` and `cancelled`, a session's with `timeout`
  and `succeeded`, with `interrupted` and `failed` or with the old name
  `run_ended_at_issuer`, two marked beyond the
  schema, which only the gateway refuses, an outcome answer with a reason and no
  state or with a reserved reason, and refusals and outcome answers with a state of no
  kind it names.
- `go test ./contracts -run TestSignedFixtures -update-signed` signs the batches under
  `fixtures/signed/` again under the fixture access key secret, after a change to a
  body; the same test without the flag checks them.
- `dev.qory.run.policy_applied` reports `variables`, one entry per name, sorted: `name`,
  `from`, the source whose value the run applies, `fixed`, `apiary`, `run`, `machine`,
  `harness` or `shell`, and `lost`, each value left out with its source and why,
  `overridden`, `denied`, `fixed` or `unwalled`. Every name the server, the run, the
  machine or the harness's defaults set is listed; a fixed name, and a name the run
  inherits, only beside one of those. Names alone, never a value.
- The node's policy narrows a server's. The mode is `enforce` when either side's is;
  the allow list is the hosts both sides allow; the deny lists add up; a request to a
  host either side holds to paths must match both; the tools and the credentials are
  the server's selection within the node's, when the node's document lists them; the
  image is the one both select or the one a side selects. A tool the narrowing refuses
  is `tool_unknown`, and two different images are `image_unknown`. A reload narrows the
  new policy by the same node policy. `dev.qory.run.policy_applied` reports the
  narrowed lists and `node_policy`: the node policy's `digest`, `sha256=` and the hex
  SHA-256 of its RFC 8785 serialisation, and its `paths`.
- Forager's own refusals are `session.Refusal` values too, with the code, the names
  they concern, never a value, and a sentence in `Detail`: `run_configuration_invalid`,
  `variable_reserved`, `placeholder_conflict`, `tool_unknown`, `image_unknown`,
  `mount_contains_forager_files`, `mount_mode_conflict`, `mount_shared_with_run`,
  `mount_through_link` and `engine_unreachable`.
  `errors.As` finds one in the error `session.Run` returns.
- `contracts/forager/v1/runtimes.json` lists the secrets of every descriptor the contract
  ships, for a server to vendor. `go generate ./contracts` writes it from the
  descriptors, and `go test ./...` fails while the file differs from them.
- Contract `v1` revision 1, amended in place, gains the files of the access key, the
  refused run and the variables that the server vendors:
  `enrolment.schema.json`, the enrolment request and its answer, a `201` that means the
  access key is active, signed with every signed refusal at enrolment under the
  enrolment answers' own domain line, `qory-enrol-answer-ed25519-v1`, once the server
  has checked the key and verified the proof under it; `events/run.refused.schema.json`,
  the data of `dev.qory.run.refused`, which `event.schema.json` lists among its types;
  and `denied-variables.json`, the built-in deny list of variable names and patterns.
  Forager's code is unchanged.
- Fixtures with the known answers of the access key: `fixtures/enrolment/`, two
  enrolment requests and the answer; and `fixtures/known-answers/`, the fixture access
  key and signing keys, the request, enrolment and answer signatures, the discovery body
  an answer covers, and the public keys enrolment refuses. The contracts tests
  recompute every one with Go's standard library: the keys from their seeds, the
  X25519 key from the access key, each signature, and the points of small order with
  integer arithmetic.
- The public package `accesskey` is the access key of the contract, for Forager and
  for qory alike. It generates a key and reads and writes its secret, `qak_` and the
  32-byte Ed25519 seed in base64url; derives the public key, its fingerprint and the
  X25519 key; runs the five checks the contract requires of a public key; builds and
  signs the GET and POST request strings; verifies a signed answer under a pin; builds
  an enrolment request with its normalised code and proof, posts it and verifies the
  answer, a signed `409` `key_limit` or `key_invalid` and a signed `429` `rate_limited`,
  under the key the code names and the enrolment answers' domain line, an unsigned
  `409` or `429` being `answer_unsigned`; and makes the instance id with the two lines of
  its file, the id and a keyed hash of the machine's identity. It verifies under no key
  the key checks refuse, refuses a document that contains a secret with
  `ErrSecretInDocument`, names a secret in no error, and prints a `Key` as its
  fingerprint however it is printed. Its tests reproduce every published known answer
  of the access key, the requests, the answers and enrolment.
- `enrolment.schema.json` defines a signed refusal at enrolment, `$defs/refusal`:
  a `409` `key_invalid` for a key already enrolled or `key_limit`, or a `429`
  `rate_limited` per code, with `apiary_public_key`, the same list in the same order as
  a `201`, so a machine without a pin verifies it as it verifies the `201`. A key the
  checks refuse or a proof that does not verify under it gets an unsigned `409`
  `key_invalid`, before the server signs anything. `fixtures/enrolment/` has the four
  `409`s, with one key and with two, and the `429` with one key, and `signatures.json`
  their signatures under the fixture signing key.
- The reference receiver accepts the public keys its configuration holds, answers in
  the contract's order of refusals, a registration whose `interval_seconds` is outside
  1 to 300 being `invalid_request`, and signs every answer after verification under its
  own key, the `410` of its `Stop` among them. Its new hook `Admit` refuses an
  instance's registration with `instance_limit`.
- `dev.qory.run.started` contains `about` when the caller passes one: what the run is
  about, as the caller passed it, every member optional. `kind` is the kind of run, at
  most 64 bytes; `title` the run's title, at most 256 bytes; `subjects` 1 to 16 objects
  of `type`, an open name of words of `a-z` and `0-9` joined by one space, underscore,
  dot or dash, at most 64 bytes, `ref`, at most 256 bytes, and `url`, an absolute `http`
  or `https` URL of at most 2048 bytes that never carries a user name or password, and
  `title`, with no two of the same `type` and `ref`; `details` a JSON object of at most
  8192 bytes as the event contains it, compacted, with `<`, `>` and `&` written as
  `\u003c`, `\u003e` and `\u0026`, nested at most 4 levels deep, with keys of 1 to 64
  bytes, shown to every reader of the run, so it never holds a secret. No string in it
  contains a control character. Toward the server, only this event and the run's
  registration contain it; it never selects a policy, and an empty `about` is left
  out. `fixtures/run/about-*.json` holds accepted and refused ones. `session.Spec.About`
  is a `session.About` of `Kind`, `Title`, `Subjects`, each a `session.Subject` of
  `Type`, `Ref`, `URL` and `Title`, and `Details`, a `json.RawMessage`; run.started
  reports `Details` as `CheckAbout` measured them. `session.CheckAbout` holds an
  `About` to these rules and returns the first failure as a `*session.AboutError`, its
  `Field`, such as `about.subjects[0].ref`, and its `Reason`; `session.Run` checks it
  before it contacts the server, and an `About` it refuses is no run.
- Contract `v1` revision 1, amended in place, gains the refusals of a gateway that
  verifies a run credential, the one the run's starter gives it: `run_credential_refused`,
  one opaque answer for every failure of the run credential and for a run key that
  already opened a run at this gateway, with no names; `target_differs_from_credential`,
  a session whose label `forge` or `repository` differs from the run credential's;
  `differs_from_credential`, a session that sends any other key the run credential
  decides, a label or an `about.details` key, with another value; and `run_id_used`, a
  run configuration request whose `run_id` already names a run at this gateway, with no
  names. The names of `target_differs_from_credential` and `differs_from_credential` are
  each member and the run credential's value, `labels.<key>=<value>` or
  `about.details.<key>=<value>`, the one value a refusal's names carry.
  `events/run.refused.schema.json` lists the four codes and says so of `names`, and
  that a run request the gateway refuses opens no run at the gateway: the session
  records the refusal it received in its own record alone, and nothing reaches the
  server for it. A gateway's `410` before the runtime starts is recorded the same way,
  as `dev.qory.run.refused` with the `410`'s code and `status` `410`: the schema's codes
  include `session_lost`, `batch_refused`, `credential_expired`, `stopped`,
  `credential_check_unreachable` and `credential_check_invalid`, and the server's `not_found`, a
  signed `404` to a run's registration,
  `accesskey.CodeNotFound`. A code without `status` is held to the schema's list; a
  code of the server's, with its `status`, is kept as the server sent it, one the list
  does not hold yet included, and a receiver shows a code it does not know as it is.
  `fixtures/batch/` has `refused-not-found.json` and
  `refused-unlisted-server-code.json`. A session that fails after the run answer and before its process
  starts posts its `dev.qory.run.refused` on the link, and the gateway delivers it;
  `refusal.RunCredentialRefused`, `refusal.TargetDiffersFromCredential`,
  `refusal.DiffersFromCredential` and `refusal.RunIDUsed` are the codes in Go, and
  `refusal.GatewayDecides` reports a gateway's code. `fixtures/batch/` has
  `refused-differs-from-credential.json`, the `dev.qory.run.refused` a session records
  when a gateway refuses its run request, in the shape of a batch.
- Contract `v1` revision 1, amended in place, gains `run-credentials.schema.json`: the
  run starters a gateway accepts run credentials from, the run's starter being the `iss`
  of its run credentials, the list under `gateway.run_credentials` of the operator's
  `forager.yaml`. Per starter: `issuer`, an https URL; `audience`,
  required; `algorithms` among `RS256`, `ES256` and `EdDSA`, never `none` or an HMAC
  algorithm; the pinned `keys`, each with its `alg`, a `public_key_file` and a `kid`;
  `leeway`, 60 s by default; `max_lifetime`; the scope `allow`; `labels`, `forge` a
  constant or a claim, `repository` the claims that name the target joined with `join`,
  a claim or a constant, and `run_key` always `sub`; `details`, the `about.details` keys
  the run credential decides, a key without `=`, since a refusal names a key as
  `about.details.<key>=<value>`; and `introspection`, an RFC 7662 endpoint with its client
  and a `cache` that defaults to the run's heartbeat interval. `fixtures/run-credentials/`
  holds two accepted documents and `fixtures/invalid/` the refused ones.
- The public package `runcredential` is the run credential of the contract. `Parse`
  reads the document against the schema, refusing a member it does not define;
  `Issuers.Check` and `Issuer.Check` refuse a key whose `alg` is not among the starter's
  algorithms, two keys without a `kid` or with the same one, the same `issuer` twice, a
  `details` key that holds `=`, a constant label value or a `join` with a control
  character, and a `public_key_file` that is not one PEM block of type `PUBLIC KEY`, with
  nothing but white space around it, of its key type: RSA of at least 2048 bits, P-256,
  or Ed25519 that passes the checks of an Ed25519 public key.
  Over a run credential: `Issuer.SelectKey` selects the pinned key by `kid` and `alg`,
  without a `kid` only while one key is pinned, and refuses `crit`; `Issuer.CheckClaims`
  checks `exp`, `iat`, `nbf`, the lifetime against `max_lifetime`, `iss`, `aud` and `sub`
  of a run credential whose signature is verified, at a given time, and refuses every one
  for a starter whose `issuer` or audience is empty; `Issuer.Allowed` is the scope;
  `Issuer.Labels` makes `forge`, `repository` and `run_key`, within the label limits and
  with no control character, refusing a label claim the run credential does not carry;
  `Issuer.Details` makes the `about.details` keys whose claims it carries, leaving the
  others to the session; and `Compare` returns `target_differs_from_credential` or
  `differs_from_credential` for what a session sends with another value, with each
  member and the run credential's value as names. Every failure of a run credential is
  `runcredential.ErrRefused`, one text that names no claim, and `runcredential.Refused`
  is its `run_credential_refused`.
- `runcredential.Key.PublicKey`, and so `Issuer.Check`, refuses the three published
  fixture keys of the known answers, `rs256.pem`, `es256.pem` and `eddsa.pem`, whose
  private keys anyone can derive from the published seed, naming the file and never the
  key.
- `fixtures/known-answers/run-credentials/` holds the fixture starter's keys, RSA 2048,
  P-256 and Ed25519, derived from a published seed, two configurations of the starter, and
  run credentials signed under the keys, accepted ones per algorithm and refused ones,
  each with its outcome at a fixed time and the step that refuses it. `go generate
  ./runcredential` writes them with Go's standard library, and `runcredential`'s list of
  the fixture keys it refuses, and `go test ./...` fails while they differ.
- `docs/gateway-run-credentials.md` says how a run's starter works with the Qory gateway:
  the claims, the algorithms, the keys and their rotation by `kid`, the gateway's own
  audience, the lifetime, introspection, the proxy login over TLS, the one opaque refusal,
  and that the run credential never appears in an event, a record or a log.
- `runcredential.NewVerifier` and `Verifier.Verify` verify a run credential under the
  starters a gateway accepts, their keys read once. The serialisation is the strict JWS
  compact form: at most `runcredential.MaxCredentialBytes`, 16384 bytes, exactly three
  parts of base64url without padding, white space or another byte, with no bits beyond
  a part's last byte. The header is one JSON object with each member name once, through
  `Issuer.SelectKey`. The signature is verified under each key the header selects, over
  the exact bytes received: `RS256` by RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 with SHA-256, `ES256` of exactly
  64 bytes with `R` and `S` each in [1, n-1], `EdDSA` by Ed25519. The payload is read only
  after a signature verified, one JSON object with each member name once, and the starter
  is the one whose key verified it and whose `issuer` equals `iss`. Then `CheckClaims`,
  `Allowed`, `Labels` and `Details`. `runcredential.Verified` holds the starter, the run
  key, `exp`, the claims, the labels and the details. Every failure is
  `runcredential.ErrRefused`, whose text holds no part of the run credential.
  `Verifier.VerifyExpired` verifies, with every step of `Verify`, a run credential
  `Verify` refuses only because its `exp` passed, less than `MaxLeeway` before.
- `Issuer.SelectKey` refuses a `typ` other than `JWT`, compared without regard to case.
- `Issuer.Check` refuses a `leeway` above `runcredential.MaxLeeway`, 5 minutes, and
  `Issuer.CheckClaims` refuses every run credential under such a starter built in Go.
  `run-credentials.schema.json` says so.
- `runcredential.NewIntrospector` and `Introspector.Active` ask a starter's RFC 7662
  endpoint whether a run credential is still active: a `POST` over TLS 1.2 or later of
  the form `token` and `token_type_hint=access_token`, with HTTP Basic as the configured
  client, the client id and the secret each form-encoded, the secret read once from its
  file; directly, through no proxy, following no redirect, each try within
  `runcredential.IntrospectionTimeout`, 2 seconds. It is active only on status 200 with
  one JSON object, each member name once, of at most
  `runcredential.MaxIntrospectionAnswer`, 65536 bytes, whose `active` is the JSON
  `true`; any other answer, or a failure, is not active. A try that gets no answer, a
  transport, TLS or timeout failure, a failed read, a `5xx` or a `429`, is tried again,
  up to 3 tries, 1 second and then 2 seconds apart, a try starting only within 4 seconds
  of the first, and then `runcredential.ErrIssuerUnreachable`; any other answer that is
  not a valid one is tried once and wraps `runcredential.ErrAnswerInvalid`, naming its
  status, "the introspection endpoint answered status 401" say. A caller whose context
  ends gets its context's error. Each answer the endpoint gives,
  active or not, is kept for the starter's `cache`, or the heartbeat interval, by the
  SHA-256 of the run credential, at most `runcredential.MaxIntrospectionAnswers`, 4096,
  the one that lapses first going when it is full; a failure is kept for no one, and the
  next caller asks again. Callers for the same run credential share one request, which
  a caller that gives up does not end for the others, and late callers join the tries
  in flight. Its errors name neither the run credential nor the secret:
  `ErrIssuerUnreachable` reads "the introspection endpoint could not be reached", and
  `ErrAnswerInvalid` "the introspection endpoint gave no valid answer".
  `Introspector.Answer` returns the whole `runcredential.Answer`: `Active`, and of an
  answer of `active: false` its `qory_outcome` and `qory_reason`, `Outcome` and `Reason`,
  by the rules of `runcredential.StarterOutcome`: an outcome other than `succeeded`,
  `failed` and `cancelled` is none, and a reason that is no code or one of Forager's
  reserved codes is dropped; neither makes the answer invalid. `Introspector.AnswerNow`
  asks past the answer kept and shares no call in flight, and keeps its answer.
- `runcredential.OpenEnded` and `runcredential.Ended` keep the run keys a gateway
  refuses, by starter, in `ended-run-keys.json` of the gateway's state directory, mode
  0600, written atomically, in a directory of mode 0700 that only its user writes. Each
  is kept until its run credential's `exp` plus 5 minutes, the longest leeway, and
  dropped on open and on `Ended.Add`; `Ended.Has` asks, and `Ended.Written` whether the
  file, as last read or written, refuses a run key, which a failed write leaves out.
  `Ended.AddOutcome` keeps the outcome and the reason the starter gave with the run key,
  those of its first hold, and `Ended.Outcome` returns them; a file whose entry holds an
  outcome or a reason a starter cannot give is refused. A
  file that cannot be read, that others can read or write, or that holds no array
  `ended` is refused, so a gateway never starts having forgotten a run key it refuses,
  and so is a directory it cannot create a file in, "the ended run keys: <directory>
  cannot be written: <error>", so a gateway never starts unable to keep one.
- The known answers of the run credential gain the step `serialisation` and run
  credentials refused at it (padding, a line feed, a space, four parts, two parts), at
  the header (`crit`, a `typ` other than `JWT`, a member name twice), at the signature
  (over an altered header; an `ES256` signature of 63 or 65 bytes, with `R` zero or `S`
  the order) and at the claims (a member name twice, no `exp`, no `aud`), and accepted
  ones with `typ` `jwt` and without `typ`. `runcredential`'s tests run
  `Verifier.Verify` on every one.
- Forager reads a run configuration with `encoding/json/v2` first, which refuses a
  member name that appears twice and invalid UTF-8, then against the schema and the
  limits: a variable's value of at most 4096 bytes of UTF-8. The error states where and
  which rule refused the document, and never quotes a value.
- Contract `v1` revision 1, amended in place, defines the gateway's link: §The
  gateway's link, between a session and its gateway, by the protocol toward the server
  on the same paths, discovery, the run configuration, the events endpoint and the `410`
  close, over two transports. The local link is a Unix socket in `qory-link-*`, mode
  `0700`, the socket `0600`, one of Forager's files; the session checks the socket's
  peer is its own user and opens every connection with `QORY-LINK` and the link secret.
  A session in the gateway's own process, as `qory` runs them on one machine, reaches
  the link in memory, with the same preamble and HTTP/1.1, and never dials the socket's
  path, where another process of the same user could stand in for the gateway.
  `gateway.Config.NoLinkSocket`, which `qory run` sets, makes no link directory and no
  socket: the link is served in memory alone, `LocalLink()` has no `Socket`, and its
  `Files` leave out the link directory and keep every other entry, the pattern of every
  gateway's link among them.
  A separate gateway speaks TLS 1.3 alone, with the operator's certificate, which the
  session verifies against the system's roots or `session.gateway.ca_file` and an
  optional pin, `session.gateway.certificate_sha256`, the SHA-256 of the certificate's
  public key in base64, and every request carries `Authorization: Bearer` and a run
  credential whose `sub` is the run's run key. Answers on the link are unsigned, and
  carry the digest headers of a reload. A coded refusal on the link is
  `link-refusal.schema.json`, `error`, `names`, `from`, required, `gateway` or
  `apiary`, the server's refusal passed on with its code and status, and `message`,
  on every refusal of the link, the `500` `internal` of a run that fails to open
  without a code among them: the text the session gives the user as the run's error,
  today's word for word, Qory Apiary's URL in it for the server's, optional, a session
  that reads none using the code, up to 8192 characters that may span lines, tab
  and newline its only control characters, with no other C0 control character, no DEL
  and no C1 control character, which holds no secret, run credential or image
  reference; every `410` on the link is one. A reload is a `GET` of
  `<run.url>/<run_id>`, answered with `link-reload-answer.schema.json`, the policy in
  force, its `digest`, `variables`, `placeholders`, `reserved`, `image` and `applied`,
  never the proxy secret or the certificate authority; on the local link the link
  secret authorises it. A run opens with a `POST`
  of `link-run-request.schema.json`: `run_id`, which the session chooses, `wall`,
  `labels`, `about`, `passes`, the names of the variables the run passes a value for,
  never a value, `images`, the session's `default` and `definitions`, each with `name`,
  `ref`, `runtime` and `docker`, whose references the gateway never logs or reports
  since one may carry a registry's credentials, and, behind a separate gateway, a
  `narrowing` that only narrows; the request is one-shot per `run_id`. Behind a
  separate gateway the run credential is decided first, a refused one `401`
  `run_credential_refused` before the body is read; then the gateway refuses the
  request in order with `invalid_request`, `run_credential_refused` for a run key that
  has a run, `run_id_used`, and `target_differs_from_credential` or
  `differs_from_credential`, the last two naming each member that differs as
  `<member>=<the run credential's value>`. With `passes`
  and `images` the gateway decides the run, and each reload, as the session decides it
  today and in the same order, before it sets anything: the policy in force, what needs
  a wall, the image, `image_unknown`, the credentials and the tools, and
  `placeholder_conflict` for a placeholder the run passes a value for. A refused start
  is a `403` with the session's code of `refusal.Decides` and `from: gateway`, while the
  server's refusals pass through with their own status and `from: apiary`; a start that
  fails without a code is a `500` `internal` from `gateway` whose `message`, the
  error's text, the session returns as its error. The gateway tries the server's
  registration up to 3 times, 1 second and then 2 seconds apart, starting a try again
  only within 6 seconds of the run request: after no answer, a `5xx`, signed or not,
  and a signed `429` `rate_limited`, every try with the same bytes, and recorded once;
  once the tries are spent the last answer is the session's, as without them. A
  `404` does not fetch the configuration document again. A signed answer at run start
  with no code is a `server.AnswerError`, with its status. A refused reload leaves the policy in
  force: behind a separate gateway it is answered as a refused start is, and on the
  local link it stays off the link. A start without a wall whose policy selects what
  needs one is `wall_required`, a `403` from `gateway` and a code of the link alone,
  named `credentials`, `tools`, `paths` or `image=<name>`: the session turns it back into
  today's error and writes no event for it, so it is not in `refusal.Decides` or in
  `dev.qory.run.refused`'s codes. On the local link the gateway applies a reload itself
  and reports every failed one, with a code or without, with today's text, and the
  reload answers the policy in force with its digest unchanged. The session still checks
  its own image table and runtime before it sends the request, and leaves out of
  `passes` a name outside the variable-name grammar.
  The answer, `link-run-answer.schema.json`, has `run_id`, `labels`, the run's labels as
  the gateway holds them, the run credential's behind a separate gateway, `details`, the
  `about.details` keys the run credential decides with its values, the policy in force
  and its `digest`, `variables`, `placeholders`, the variables the agent sees in place of
  a credential or a tool's secret, `reserved`, the variables the machine's credentials
  are read from, which a walled run that passes one is refused for, `variable_reserved`,
  and whose value an unwalled run has left out, `image`, the image the run gets when it has a wall, `applied`,
  required, the members of `dev.qory.run.policy_applied` the gateway decides, every one
  but `variables` and `harness_hosts`, which the session adds to write its own, the run's
  `proxy_secret`, its `run_secret`, which the session sends in the header
  `X-Qory-Run-Secret` on every reload and batch, and its `certificate_authority` when
  `wall` is true and the gateway
  reads inside HTTPS for the run, for a credential, a tool or a path rule, and behind a
  wall with a server always; the session's `dev.qory.run.started` contains exactly
  those labels, and those keys with those values. Discovery on the link is
  `link-discovery.schema.json`, with `events.interval_seconds`, the gateway's heartbeat
  interval, `proxy.address`, the gateway's proxy as `host:port`, on loopback on one
  machine, and no `node_id`, `workspaces`, `apiary_public_key` or `secrets`; a batch is
  `link-batch.schema.json`, events without `sequence`, which the gateway numbers. A
  session writes no event the gateway or the run credential decides: the gateway
  refuses a batch, `400` `invalid_request`, nothing of it numbered, with an event of
  another run; a `dev.qory.run.registered` or a `dev.qory.run.egress`, which the gateway writes; a
  `dev.qory.run.started` not opened by the session, whose `labels` or `about.details`
  differ from what the gateway holds or the run credential decides, or a second one; an
  event after the run's `dev.qory.run.exited` or `dev.qory.run.refused`, or a
  `dev.qory.run.refused` after its `dev.qory.run.started`; a `dev.qory.run.exited` with
  a `reason` other than `timeout` and `interrupted`, both `cancelled`, or than the reason of the gateway's outcome answer to
  the run, since the gateway writes the event of every other reason itself; a `dev.qory.run.policy_applied` that is not the `applied` of an answer
  of this run with the session's `harness_hosts` and `variables` added, any policy the
  gateway has put in force for the run matching, so a batch in flight during a reload
  is not refused; or a `dev.qory.run.refused` whose code is not one of
  `refusal.Decides`, or with a name `<member>=<value>`. The schema states the types,
  `opened_by`, `timeout` and `interrupted` as the ones of Forager's reasons and the codes and names of
  `dev.qory.run.refused`. A batch without the run's `run_secret`, or with one of no
  such run, is `400` `invalid_request` on the local link, and ends no run; a batch whose
  body does not arrive whole, its client gone before the end, is `400`
  `invalid_request` too, and ends no run. Any other `400` `invalid_request` to a batch
  ends its run at the gateway: the gateway writes `dev.qory.run.exited`, `failed` with
  `batch_refused`, refuses the run's proxy secret and answers
  the session's further requests with a `410` `batch_refused`; the session stops the
  runtime and writes its own `dev.qory.run.exited`, `failed` with `batch_refused`, as the
  gateway's, in its own record and never posted.
  `dev.qory.run.policy_applied` is the session's, from the run answer and a reload
  answer whose digest changed; into a session's run the gateway merges its own
  `dev.qory.run.egress`, every one after a reload's switch held until the session's
  `dev.qory.run.policy_applied` of the new policy is numbered, and, when it ends the
  run, its `dev.qory.run.exited`, and it
  writes `dev.qory.run.policy_applied` for a run with no session. A walled agent never
  reaches the local link's socket, and an unwalled one is never given the link secret:
  `qory` hands the session the secret in memory, never in an environment or a file, so
  a program the agent starts does not inherit it. A session's heartbeats are its run's,
  and a session silent for 3 × the interval ends the run, `session_lost`. When the
  gateway ends a session's run, with `session_lost`, `batch_refused`,
  `credential_expired`, `stopped`, the starter's outcome,
  `credential_check_unreachable` or `credential_check_invalid`, it writes the run's
  `dev.qory.run.exited` itself, with the state of that end and `-1`, and delivers it
  toward the server. It answers the session's next request and every one after it with
  a `410`, and the session writes its own `dev.qory.run.exited`, with the state and the
  reason that `410` gives, as the gateway's, in its own record and never posted, and
  posts nothing more. The `410`'s code is, from `gateway`, `credential_expired`, `stopped`,
  `credential_check_unreachable`, `credential_check_invalid`, `session_lost` after a silent
  session, or `batch_refused` after a refused batch. Every `410` on the link carries `from`, and the gateway's own `410`
  `run_closed` to a request of a run already ended is unchanged. A server's signed
  `410`, with any code or none, stops delivery: the gateway sends no further batch for
  the run and marks its record `stopped`, and the run goes on, its record keeping every
  event. A `410` to the registration, signed or not, is no run, and no refusal: no
  server's `410` crosses the link. The relay opens its
  connections with `QORY-RELAY` and the run's proxy secret, over TLS 1.3 with the
  link's trust between two machines, and without a wall the agent's proxy URL carries
  the secret as its password. `fixtures/link/` holds the valid documents, refusals from
  `gateway` and from `apiary` among them, most with today's text as their `message`,
  the gateway's with the `: <code>: <names>` tail, and the signed `409`
  `instance_limit` to the registration from `apiary` with the server's `run.url` in it, and
  `fixtures/invalid/link-*` the refused ones, a discovery without `proxy`, a run request that passes a value with a name or
  whose image has no `ref`, a run answer without `labels` or `applied` or whose image
  has no `ref`, a reload answer whose `applied` holds `variables`, a refusal without
  `from` or with a control character other than tab and newline in its `message`, a
  C1 one among them, and
  a batch with a
  `dev.qory.run.egress`, a `dev.qory.run.started` a gateway opened, a
  `dev.qory.run.exited` with each of Forager's reasons but `timeout` and `interrupted`, and a `dev.qory.run.refused`
  with each gateway's code, `run_closed`, a code of the server's or a name
  `<member>=<value>` among them. Package `link` has `LinkPreamble`, `LinkDirPrefix`,
  `LinkSocketName`, `LinkDirMode`, `LinkSocketMode` and `BearerScheme`.
- `link.Local` is what a session needs of a gateway on the same machine: its link
  socket, the link secret, its proxy address, the files a walled run must not mount and
  the variables it reserves; fmt and log/slog print its secret as `[redacted]`. The one
  `(*gateway.Gateway).LocalLink()` hands out reaches the gateway in memory,
  `Local.IsInMemory`; `Local.DialContext` opens a connection in memory when it has that
  way, `Local.InMemory`, and to the socket otherwise, and `server.NewLocalLink` dials
  that way alone.
  `link.WriteLinkPreamble` and `link.ReadLinkPreamble` write and read the link's
  preamble, compared in constant time in a read of exactly its length, beside
  `link.Preamble`, `link.PreambleWait`, `link.MaxSecret` and `link.ToolDirPrefix`;
  `link.ReadRelayPreamble` reads the relay's the same way.
- `server.NewRemoteLink(url, server.RemoteTLS{CAFile, CertificateSHA256}, credential,
  userAgent, digests)` is the client of a separate gateway's link, with the local
  link's `Discover`, `OpenRun`, `Reload` and `Deliver` and their refusals: an `https`
  URL of a host and an optional port alone; TLS 1.3 alone; the system's roots, or the
  CA file's authorities in their place; the URL's host name; the pin, the SHA-256 of
  the certificate's DER SubjectPublicKeyInfo in standard base64 with padding, checked
  after the chain; no proxy of the environment and no redirect; and
  `Authorization: Bearer` with the run credential, asked for before every request and
  sent only in the syntax of RFC 6750 §2.1, never in an error or a print. Its discovery
  must list the gateway's origin alone and name its one address as the proxy.
  `Link.DialProxy` opens a connection to that address over TLS with the same trust, and
  `Link.ProxyAddress` names it.
- `server.Delivery` has `Refusal`: on the link, a coded answer other than a `2xx` as the
  `*accesskey.Refusal` it is, with its code, status, names, who refused and its
  message.
- `server.RunEnd` is how a run ended at the gateway, as the link says it: `Code`, one of
  `server.EndCodes`, `From`, and `State` and `Reason`, the state and the reason a `410`
  that ends a run carries, each held to `run.exited.schema.json`'s, and both empty for
  a `410` that carries none, `run_closed`, or one the schema refuses. `server.Ended`
  returns it from a `410` of the link, and `server.Delivery` has `State` and `Reason`
  beside `End` and `From`, and `Delivery.RunEnd` returns all four.
  `(*server.Link).Outcome(ctx, runURL, runID)` asks a separate
  gateway once for the run's outcome, `GET <runURL>/<runID>/outcome` with the run
  credential and the run's secret as a reload carries them, bounded to
  `server.OutcomeTimeout`, 10 seconds, and returns a `server.LinkOutcome`, `State` and
  `Reason`: the starter's outcome from a `200` that `link-outcome-answer.schema.json`
  accepts, a reason that is one of Forager's reserved codes, or one the schema refuses,
  dropped alone and the state kept, and `{}` for anything else, an error, no answer in
  time, another status, a `410` among them, or an answer that is not valid, a state the
  schema refuses among them. On the local
  link it sends nothing and returns `{}`. On a link sink, `(*sink.Server).Resend` takes a line of the session's record
  and posts it without its sequence. `(*sink.Server).RunEnded` records that an answer
  the sink did not read itself, a reload's `410`, ended the run: nothing more is sent,
  `RunClosed` reports true, and `delivered.log` says `stopped`.
- `accesskey.Refusal` has `From`: `accesskey.FromApiary` for a code read from the
  server's signed answer and for its `401` `unauthorized` at run start,
  `accesskey.FromGateway` for one a gateway decides, made by `refusal.ByGateway`, and
  empty for one Forager decides, `answer_unsigned` or `apiary_public_key_missing`; its
  text is unchanged.

#### Changed

- The module is a core and three parts over it. The core, at the root, is `contracts`,
  `accesskey`, `receiver`, `policy`, `refusal`, `event`, `sink`, `server`, `program`,
  and `link`, which holds the names the parts agree on.
- Contract `v1` revision 1 is amended in place for a run's variables and a node that
  narrows the server's policy. `run-configuration.schema.json` has `variables`, at most
  128 names of `^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]{0,127}$` with string values without NUL,
  carriage return or line feed, and `security_policy` is optional: without it the
  node's policy is the run's. `events/run.policy_applied.schema.json` has `variables`
  and `node_policy`, and allows `url` and `run_configuration` beside `source` `config`
  or `none`. The README gains §Variables and the narrowing table in §The policy, and
  §The server reads that the launch spec's policy narrows a fetched policy.
  `fixtures/invalid/run-configuration-no-policy.json` is now
  `fixtures/run-configuration/no-policy.json`, `{"version": 1}`; the run configuration
  fixtures gain `variables.json`, and the invalid ones a variable that is no string and
  one with a line feed.
- The README is short. It lists Forager's four jobs: it records the session,
  enforces a policy, walls the agent in with the secrets kept outside, and reports to a
  server. It shows that `qory run` starts Forager, and where a run's policy comes
  from. `docs/` contains the rest, one page per topic.
- The docs and the contract's README name qory's `~/.config/qory/forager.yaml` and its
  `session`, `gateway` and `wall` sections: the machine's policy is `gateway.egress`, and
  the server `gateway.server`.
- Contract `v1` revision 1 is amended in place: §The descriptor has six parts,
  `secrets` among them, defines `title` and the bound on `runtime`, and describes
  `runtimes.json`.
- Contract `v1` revision 1 is amended in place again: §Images lists what `dockerd`
  starts among the programs in the system directories, and §The wall defines the
  daemon's environment, the owners and modes of `/run/qory` and the agent's docker
  configuration, and that a non-empty `DOCKER_CONFIG` of the run's takes the place of
  that configuration.
- `dev.qory.run.started` records `command` and `args` as the runtime prepared them, as
  Forager always did; `run.started.schema.json` and §Sequence now say so. For an
  interactive Claude Code whose API key is a placeholder, `command` is `/bin/sh` and
  `args` hold the script in the run directory, then `claude` and its arguments.
- Contract `v1` revision 1 is amended in place again: a runtime in §The runtime defines
  seven things, the secrets it declares among them, through `runtimes.Secrets` in Go;
  its preparation receives the variables the enclosure gets the placeholder value in,
  and may change the command and the arguments, so it may start the program through a
  script it writes into the run directory. §The descriptor describes Claude Code's
  approval of an API key and the script that pre-approves the placeholder value, and
  §Sequence's steps 6 and 7 list the script.
- Contract `v1` revision 1 is amended in place: Forager signs every request with an
  access key, an Ed25519 key, and verifies every answer under the server's key it pins.
  The server document has `url`, `access_key_id` and the pin `apiary_public_key`, and
  no secret; `gateway.Server` has the same members, and `AccessKey`, `InstanceID` and
  `InstanceName`, which `session.Server` and `session.Spec` had until a session spoke
  to a gateway alone (Session, Upgrading). Every request
  contains `X-Qory-Access-Key-Id`, `X-Qory-Instance-Id`, `X-Qory-Instance-Name` and
  `X-Qory-Signature-Ed25519`, over the request string of a GET or a POST. Every answer
  but a `401` is signed under the server's key and bound to the request's signature,
  and Forager reads its body and headers only once it verifies; during a run an
  answer that does not verify is retried. §The server defines the access key, nodes
  and instances, the pin, the request string, signed answers, the coded refusals and
  their order, and enrolment.
- Discovery lists `node_id`, `workspaces` and `apiary_public_key`, each required, and
  `secrets` for an access key allowed stored secrets. `workspaces` holds exactly one id,
  `ws_` and 16 lower-case Crockford base32 characters: the workspace the access key's
  node or node pool belongs to, which is Qory Apiary's and not the directory a run works
  in.
  A document without `workspaces`, or with two, is refused. `server.Configuration` has
  `Workspaces`.
- The registration's `interval_seconds` is the run's heartbeat interval, a whole
  number of seconds from 1 to 300, `gateway.Config.Heartbeat`, which the heartbeats
  tick at. `elapsed_seconds` counts, on a session's run, from the session's discovery of its
  gateway's link, and on a run a gateway opened, from the run's registration.
  `dev.qory.run.exited`'s `reason` has `run_closed`.
- `fixtures/server/` and `fixtures/signed/` use the fixture access key and Ed25519.
  `fixtures/signed/` has `get-configuration-no-instance-id` and `-header-twice`,
  `batch-unknown-key` in place of `batch-wrong-key`, and
  `expect_code` for a coded refusal. `fixtures/invalid/` has
  `server-no-access-key-id`, `server-no-pin`, `server-secret-member` and
  `event-registered-interval-too-long` in place of `server-no-key`;
  `fixtures/configuration/with-secrets.json` is new; the configuration fixtures list
  `node_id`, `workspaces` and `apiary_public_key`; and the `dev.qory.run.registered` of
  the recorded runs contains `workspace`, `node_id`, `instance_id` and
  `interval_seconds`. `fixtures/invalid/` has `configuration-no-workspaces`,
  `configuration-two-workspaces`, `event-registered-no-workspace` and
  `link-discovery-workspaces`, and the discovery known answer, its body, digest and
  signature, is recomputed.
- The contract is at `contracts/forager/v1`, and every `$id` and `dataschema` is
  `https://qory.dev/contracts/forager/v1/…`. `dev.qory.run.registered` and
  `dev.qory.run.started` contain `forager_version`; `dev.qory.run.exited`'s `reason` for a run whose end was
  not recorded is `gateway_lost`; and the refusal code of a mount that holds Forager's
  own files is `mount_contains_forager_files`, `refusal.MountContainsForagerFiles`.
  `accesskey.UserAgent(version)` builds the `User-Agent` of every request to a server,
  `qory-forager/<version>`. The four batch fixtures under `fixtures/signed` are signed
  over their new bodies.
  The module is `github.com/qoryai/forager`, so `go get github.com/qoryai/forager` and
  every import path start with it.
- Contract `v1` revision 1 is amended in place for a run a gateway opens, with no
  session and no process. `dev.qory.run.started` has `opened_by`, `session` or
  `gateway`, required, and `credential`, required: `starter`, the run's starter gave
  the run its run credential, for a session's run behind a separate gateway and every
  run a gateway opened, and `none` for a run on the local link, which the gateway
  decides, puts in its run answer, required there too, and holds a session's
  `run.started` to; nothing else of the starter is reported. Opened by a session it requires what it did,
  and opened by a gateway it contains none of `runtime`, `runtime_version`, `command`, `args`, `dir`,
  `interactive`, `terminal`, `host`, `wall` and `image`. `forager_version` is the
  version of what opened the run, and `host` is the agent's machine's. A gateway-opened
  run's `labels`, `run_key` among them, and `about.details` come from the run
  credential's mapping. `dev.qory.run.exited`'s `reason` has `session_lost`, the
  session was silent, `batch_refused`, the gateway refused a batch of its, `quiet`,
  `credential_expired` and `stopped`, which the gateway writes, beside
  `timeout`, `interrupted`, `run_closed` and `gateway_lost`; when the gateway ends a session's run it
  writes the run's `dev.qory.run.exited`, and the session writes its own, with the state
  and the reason of the gateway's `410`, in its own record and never posted. `quiet_seconds`, the quiet period the gateway applied, is present
  with `quiet` alone. `exit_code` is optional: a session's run contains it, `-1` with
  `gateway_lost` and in every `dev.qory.run.exited` the gateway writes for it,
  `session_lost` included, and a run a gateway opened none, `gateway_lost` included.
  `state` is required on every `dev.qory.run.exited`, `failed` with `gateway_lost`; the
  schema fixes `exit_code` to `-1` with `gateway_lost` when it is present.
  The README's events table, §The events and §Fixtures say so. Every `run.started` in
  the fixtures contains `opened_by` and `credential`, and the four batches under
  `fixtures/signed` are signed over their new bodies. `fixtures/run/` has a run a
  gateway opened, which ends `quiet`, `fixtures/batch/` its first and last batch and
  the `dev.qory.run.exited` of such a run that ends `gateway_lost`, and
  `fixtures/invalid/` nine refused `run.started` and `run.exited` events, two of them
  without a `credential` or with one of no kind it names, and a run answer without
  `credential`.
- The server judges a run's liveness by its heartbeats' own `time`, corrected by the
  run's clock offset, with a tolerance of 300 seconds and never later than their
  arrival, and a delivery id is never used again for other events.

### Gateway

#### Upgrading

- Package `gateway` exports `gateway.Start`, its `Config` and the `Gateway` it returns,
  with `Addr`, `LocalLink`, `Close` and `Wait`, and `String`, `Format`, `GoString` and
  `LogValue`, which never print the link secret; `gateway.Resend`, its `ResendConfig`,
  `Delivery` and `ErrRunning`; and the types their fields need: `Server`, `TLS`,
  `Policy` with `Under`, `ReadPolicy`, `PolicyEgress`, `PolicyCredential`, `PolicyTool`,
  `Credential`, `Tool`, `Discovery` and `Image`. `Proxy`, `Decision`, `CA`,
  `ProxyCredential`, `ProxyTool`, `CredentialDefinition`, `HeldCredentials`,
  `ToolDefinition`, `ChosenTool`, `Tools`, `Listen`, `NewCA`, `ResolveCredentials`,
  `ChooseTools`, `CheckTools`, `ToolPlaceholders`, `StartTools` and `ToolSocketDirs` are
  removed: `gateway.Start` starts the one proxy every run shares, and for each run a
  session opens on its link resolves the credentials and starts the tools the run's
  policy selects among `gateway.Config`'s `Credentials` and `Tools`. A test in
  `internal/importrules` fails on any other export.
- `gateway.TLS` is `{CertFile, KeyFile}`, in place of `{Certificate, Key}`, and
  `gateway.Config` has `Listen`, `TLS`, `RunCredentials` and `Runs`, a `RunsConfig`.
  `Start` with `Listen` empty serves the local link alone, as before, and refuses a
  `TLS` without a `Listen`.
- `ended-run-keys.json` keeps the outcome and the reason a run's starter gave with each
  run key it holds. A gateway from before this change refuses the file only when an
  entry holds an outcome, and then does not start; a file without one still loads. Run
  the newer gateway until the run keys with an outcome lapse, `exp` plus 5 minutes,
  before going back.

#### Added

- `gateway.Config.Listen`, the gateway's one address, served beside the local link.
  Every connection is routed by its first bytes, after the TLS handshake when there is
  TLS, within the time and the size the relay's preamble has: `QORY-RELAY` and a run's
  proxy secret to that run's proxy; a proxy request, `CONNECT` or an absolute-form
  target, to the proxy of the run its `Proxy-Authorization` names, the password of
  Basic a live run's proxy secret or else a run credential, and `407` with
  `Proxy-Authenticate: Basic realm="qory"` without one; anything else to the contract,
  where every request's `Authorization: Bearer` run credential is decided first and a
  request without one, or with one refused, is `401` `run_credential_refused` from the
  gateway, with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer`.
- The one address verifies run credentials under the run starters of
  `gateway.Config.RunCredentials`, their keys pinned. A session's run request there is
  decided by its run credential: the run's labels and `about.details` are the run
  credential's, and the run answer carries them; a session's `forge` or `repository`
  that differs is `403` `target_differs_from_credential`, another label or detail the
  mapping sets `403` `differs_from_credential`, each naming the run credential's value;
  its `run.started` must carry the same `about.details`. The gateway tracks run keys
  and does not require them to be unique; each period of activity is a run: every run
  request opens a run of its own, of its own run id and proxy secret, with the run key
  as its `run_key` label. Every later request of the run carries a run credential of
  its run key, a refreshed one carrying only its own run to its `exp`, its labels and
  `about.details` the run's, else `403` `target_differs_from_credential` or
  `differs_from_credential`, and a client's connection `407`; one of another run key
  is `401`; every reload and batch also carries the run's `run_secret`, which the run
  answer gives: a batch is of that run, and any other request of the run key is `401`,
  so no run can be probed. A batch over the limit, or one that does not decode, ends
  its run, `batch_refused`.
  The run ends at its latest `exp` with no fresher run credential,
  `credential_expired`; when the starter's introspection endpoint no longer holds its run
  credential active, `stopped`; and when the run credential could not be checked, the
  introspection endpoint unreachable after the tries, `credential_check_unreachable`, or
  its answer not valid, `credential_check_invalid`, neither of which holds the run key: the gateway
  writes its
  `dev.qory.run.exited`, and every later request gets the `410` with that code, a
  reload or a batch even with a run credential whose `exp` passed less than 5 minutes
  before, which reaches nothing else. A run request whose starter's endpoint could not
  be reached is a `503` `credential_check_unreachable`, with the message "the run did
  not start: its run credential could not be checked; try again", and one whose
  endpoint gave no valid answer a `502` `credential_check_invalid`, with "the run did
  not start: its run credential could not be checked"; neither opens or records a run.
  After the starter's end, the gateway refuses every request of a run of the run key until the
  latest `exp` of the run credentials of the key the gateway still holds, and of any
  presented during the hold, plus `runcredential.MaxLeeway`, 5 minutes: those of the run
  key's live runs, and of its ended runs whose record is not yet flushed. During the
  hold, a session's run request is `401` `run_credential_refused`, a reload or a batch
  of a session's run of the run key that is still live the run's `410`
  `stopped`, which ends the run, and a client's connection `407`, which ends
  the client's run of the run key it would join, `stopped`; the discovery is
  answered to a run credential of the run key as to any, and opens nothing; a run
  credential for a refused run key presented during the hold, verified, is refused and
  extends the hold to its own `exp`, and one that fails verification extends nothing.
  The gateway keeps these run keys in `ended-run-keys.json` in its directory, so a
  restart refuses them too; a write of it that fails is reported once, the run key's
  requests are refused all the same while the gateway runs, and the file is written
  again on each refused request of the run key, every 5 seconds, and once more at Close,
  until a write succeeds; the write that succeeds again is reported, and at Close, when
  the write still fails, how many run keys a restart would not refuse. A
  session's narrowing is accepted on the one address and narrows the run's policy, at
  its start and on each reload; it opens none of the gateway's own addresses, which
  only the policy before it opens, when it enforces and names the host itself. Its
  `dev.qory.run.policy_applied` has the `source` of the policy it narrows, with the
  narrowed policy's own `digest`, and `source` `config` for a narrowing of no policy.
  The local link reaches none of the one address's runs.
- A client with no session sets the gateway's one address as its HTTPS proxy, its run
  credential the password of Basic in `Proxy-Authorization`; every failure of its login
  is the same `407`, with `Proxy-Authenticate: Basic realm="qory"` and the text "a
  valid run credential is required as the proxy password". A connection of a run key
  with no open client's run opens one, of the gateway's own run id, decided as a
  walled run, with the credentials, the tools and the path rules its policy selects,
  as a session's run: the gateway registers it and writes its `dev.qory.run.registered`, `dev.qory.run.started` with `opened_by` `gateway` and
  the run credential's labels and `about.details`, its `dev.qory.run.policy_applied`,
  every connection's `dev.qory.run.egress`, and its heartbeats; its proxy reads inside
  HTTPS with the gateway's own authority. Every later connection of the run key joins
  the run while it is open; a client has at most one open run per run key, and never
  joins a session's run, which only its proxy secret reaches. The run ends after
  `Runs.Quiet` with no connection, `quiet`, with `quiet_seconds`; at its `exp`; or when
  the starter says it has ended. The gateway asks the starter at each connection. It
  also asks about a run with no traffic, once in each heartbeat interval in which nothing
  else asked about its run credential, so it learns of the starter's end within about
  one heartbeat interval plus the answer's `cache`. The run's `dev.qory.run.exited` holds
  its `state` and no `exit_code`. An idle client run is now asked too, so a starter's
  introspection endpoint that cannot be reached while the run is idle ends it `failed`
  with `credential_check_unreachable`, and one that gives no valid answer ends it
  `failed` with `credential_check_invalid`; before, an idle client run was never asked.
  A run that ended is never opened again: the next connection of its run key opens a
  new run, of a new run id. A run refused with a code gets the gateway's
  `dev.qory.run.refused` with that code in place of `dev.qory.run.started`; one that fails without
  a code gets no event. Its connection gets a `503` with the text "the gateway could not
  open the run; try again" for a failure that may pass, the starter's introspection
  endpoint unreachable or Qory Apiary's `5xx`, signed or not, with any code or none, or its
  signed `429` `rate_limited`, once the tries are spent, among it, at once for Qory
  Apiary's `410` to the registration, signed or not, with any code or
  none,
  and for one with neither a code nor a status of Qory
  Apiary's; and a `403` with one line for a reason that does not pass: "the gateway
  could not open the run: Qory Apiary refused it, \<code\>" for a code of Qory
  Apiary's answer, `answer_unsigned` among them, "the gateway could not open the run:
  the gateway refused it, \<code\>" for one the gateway decides, "the gateway could not
  open the run: Qory Apiary refused it, status \<n\>" for a signed answer, other than a
  `5xx` or a `410`, with no code,
  and "the run did not start: its run credential could not be checked". A connection that would join a run whose starter's endpoint could not
  be reached, or gave no valid answer, ends the run and gets the same `503` or `403`. A refusal's answer is written in
  full, the connection's writing side closed and what the client still sends read
  briefly before it closes, so no reset takes the answer's place.
- Every run of the one address ends with a state and a reason. A starter that answers
  `active: false` with `qory_outcome` and `qory_reason` ends the run with them, and
  every live run of the run key with the same, kept with the hold in
  `ended-run-keys.json` so a later request and a restart get the same end; with no
  outcome the run ends `cancelled` with `stopped`. The gateway's `dev.qory.run.exited`
  and its `410` carry that `state` and `reason`, a client's run's too, and the `410`'s
  message reads "the run has ended: \<state\>[, \<reason words\>]", such as "the run
  has ended: cancelled, no outcome given". A refused batch is `failed` with
  `batch_refused` in the gateway's own record, as in the session's.
- `GET <run path>/<run id>/outcome` on the one address answers the session's ask at
  its runtime's exit, decided as a reload: the starter is asked once per run, past the
  answer kept, asks in flight sharing that call and a later ask getting the answer
  stored, within about 6 seconds; a later ask is decided as a reload, so once the
  starter has ended the run key it is the `410`, and only the first keeps the run from
  being lost while it is made, though a later ask still counts as the session's while
  its run credential is being checked, as any request does; the answer is `{}`, or the
  starter's `state` and `reason` when it answers
  `active: false` with an outcome. From the start of the ask, while it is made and for
  30 seconds after its answer, a run credential of that run that could not be checked
  does not end it: its heartbeats, reloads and batches go on, and its
  `dev.qory.run.exited` is decided against the answer; after that, before the ask and
  for the run key's other runs it ends the run as before. A request whose run
  credential is being checked counts as the session's, so the run is not lost while
  the endpoint is slow. The local link answers it
  `400` `invalid_request`. An answer of `active: false` holds the run key and ends the
  run key's other live runs at their next request, and the run that asked may end with
  its own `dev.qory.run.exited` of that answer, or after `{}` one its runtime's exit
  decides, for 30 seconds: any other batch, a reload or any request after them gets the
  `410` of the answer, and at their end the gateway ends the run itself as the starter
  said, never `session_lost`; within them the answer wins over the run credential's
  `exp`. While the starter is asked, the run is not lost for want of the session's
  requests. With no outcome, the gateway holds the session's `dev.qory.run.exited` to
  the runtime's exit: `succeeded` with exit status 0 and no reason, `failed` with any
  other or a signal and no reason, or `cancelled` with `timeout`, or with `interrupted`
  and any exit status or signal.
- `gateway.Delivery` has `ClosedReason`, the code of the gateway's `410` of the first
  run that ended at the gateway, in place of `Reason`, and `State` and `Reason`, how
  that run ended, the state and the reason of the gateway's `dev.qory.run.exited` of
  it; for a resend that completes the record, `failed` and `gateway_lost`.
  `Delivery.ClosedBy` is removed: it always said `gateway`.
- Each line the gateway reports of a run's end reads `run <id>: <what happened>; the
  run ends: <state>[, <reason words>]`: "its session sent nothing for 1m30s; the run
  ends: failed", "its run credential is no longer valid; the run ends: failed, checks
  failed", "its run credential could not be checked: the introspection endpoint could
  not be reached; the run ends: failed". Every line and message a person reads calls
  the run's starter "the starter": the configuration's errors say so, `run_credentials:
  the starter https://issuer.example appears twice` say, and the server's signed `410` is "the
  server wants no more events of this run; the run goes on".
- Once a run of the one address has ended and its record is flushed, and after the
  starter's end its run key is kept, the gateway holds only how a later request of the
  run is answered, until a run credential of it can no longer be accepted. A gateway's own authority keeps at
  most 1024 hosts' certificates, the least recently used going first.
- A run's end closes every tunnel of its proxy, at both ends, and the connections whose
  TLS the proxy ends, so no connection relays past the run.
- `gateway.Config.TLS`, the operator's certificate and key: the one address speaks TLS
  1.3 alone. A plain listener is allowed on loopback alone. `Start` refuses a `Listen`
  that is not `host:port`, one that is not loopback without `TLS`, certificate and key
  files it cannot read or that do not match, and a `Listen` without `RunCredentials` or
  without `Dir`.
- The discovery on the one address lists every URL on the origin the session reached,
  by its `Host`, and `proxy.address` that same address.
- The proxy of every run served through the one address is guarded, whatever its wall:
  the machine's own addresses are refused unless the policy's allow list names the
  host, as for a walled run. A local run's proxy, which may not be guarded, is never
  reached from the one address.
- With `Listen`, the gateway keeps a certificate authority of its own in its directory,
  `authority/ca.pem`, the directory mode `0700` and the file `0600`: made once, reused
  by every later start, for its proxy to read inside HTTPS for the clients with no
  session, whose machines trust it. A directory or a file another user may reach is
  refused.
- `gateway.Config.Runs.Quiet`, how long a run with no session lasts with no connection;
  30 minutes when zero.
- `gateway.Delivery.NotOpened` says a resend to a server sent nothing, and left the
  record as it is, since the run never opened at that server: its registration was
  refused, or it had no server. With no server it is never set: the resend completes
  every record, and leaves one that holds no event as it is, with no error. `gateway.ResendNotOpened` and `gateway.ResendNoServer` are the lines the
  resend reports then, which a caller that reports `NotOpened` itself may leave out,
  and `gateway.ResendTorn` the one for lines of the record that are not whole events,
  a format of their count and the record's path. `gateway.Delivery.Stopped` says the
  server answered a signed `410` and wants no more events of the run: during the run,
  so the resend sent nothing, or during the resend, with `Sent` what the server
  accepted before it and `Undelivered` what was not sent, which stays in the record's
  `events.jsonl`, none under `undelivered/`.

#### Changed

- A run request whose session gives up waiting for its run answer, ten seconds, opens
  no run: once its connection goes, the gateway asks Qory Apiary nothing more for it,
  its registration among it, and removes what it recorded of the run, so the same
  `run_id` sent again opens the run instead of `run_id_used`. Within 150 seconds of its
  `time`, with
  every member of the registration but `time` the same, the gateway sends the server
  the same registration bytes again, which a server that accepted them answers the
  same; after that, or with other labels or another `about`, the server answers
  `run_id_used`. Before,
  the run opened and ended `session_lost` after three heartbeat intervals. A session
  that goes while the run answer is on its way may still leave such a run.
- A `gateway_lost` that `gateway.Resend` writes for a run a gateway opened holds
  `state` `failed` and no `exit_code`.
- The gateway is `gateway`, over `gateway/internal/{proxy,credential,tool}`.
- The organization of the run's certificate authority is `Forager gateway, one run
  only`. The gateway's `403` for a link-local address or the machine's own address
  reads "qory: egress to <host>:<port> denied by the gateway: link-local addresses are
  never reached through it, and the gateway's own machine only for a host the policy's
  allow list names", and for an ambiguous path "qory: <method> <host><path> denied by the
  gateway: the path could be read two ways".

#### Fixed

- `gateway.Resend` reads on past a line of `events.jsonl` that holds no whole event, a
  write the gateway did not finish, on a full disk: it skips those bytes, and keeps and
  sends every event the gateway wrote after them, one the next write put on the same
  line too, the object that ends the line, never one inside the bytes before it. When
  those bytes are themselves exactly one whole event, a write that lost its newline
  alone, it is kept too. A whole event numbered at or below the one before it is
  skipped. Before, it cut the file at that line, and every event after it was lost. A
  last line without its newline that is a whole event is kept, and gets its newline
  before `gateway_lost` follows it; any other is cut off, as before. The resend
  reports "<n> lines of <file> are not whole events and are not sent". `gateway_lost`
  is numbered after the highest sequence of the whole events or of `delivered.log`,
  since an event whose line was not finished may have reached the server whole, and the
  file is changed only when `gateway_lost` is added.
- `gateway.Resend` to a server sends nothing of a record with no
  `dev.qory.run.registered`, no `delivered.log` and no `dev.qory.run.started`, of a run
  that never opened there. Nothing is added to its `events.jsonl`, the `Delivery` says
  `NotOpened`, nothing sent, and the resend reports "the run never opened at the
  server; nothing is sent". Before, its ping and events were posted, which reported a
  run that never opened. The same holds of a record with neither mark and a
  `dev.qory.run.started`, of a run that had no server, sent to a server: it never
  opened there, and the resend reports "the run had no server; nothing is sent".
  Before, its events were posted without a ping. A record with a
  `dev.qory.run.registered` or a `delivered.log` is sent. With no server, the resend
  completes every record as any other, without a word, and leaves one that holds no
  event as it is, with no error.

### Wall

#### Upgrading

- In an image with a Docker of the agent's own, `dockerd` runs with `/usr/local/sbin`,
  `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/sbin`, `/usr/bin`, `/sbin` and `/bin` as its whole `PATH`, so
  these directories contain the programs it starts, `containerd`, `runc` and `iptables`
  among them. Of the run's environment it gets the proxy and, when the run has one, the
  run's certificate bundle. `docker:dind` needs no change.
- A link at `/run/qory` or `/run/qory/docker` in an image with a Docker of the agent's
  own stops the run when the wall writes the agent's docker configuration there, which
  it does whenever the run sets no `DOCKER_CONFIG` or an empty one. `wall.Nest` followed
  it before.

#### Added

- `wall.Engined` is a wall whose enclosures are containers of an engine; its `Engine` is a
  `wall.Engine`: the adapter, `docker` whichever command it runs, the command, absolute
  when found in PATH, the variables that select the engine, `DOCKER_HOST`,
  `DOCKER_CONTEXT`, `DOCKER_CONFIG`, `DOCKER_CERT_PATH`, `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY`,
  `CONTAINER_HOST`, `CONTAINER_CONNECTION`, `CONTAINERD_ADDRESS` and
  `CONTAINERD_NAMESPACE`, a password in an address left out and an address that cannot be
  read left out whole, `Pinned`, and the engine's id, `info --format {{.ID}}`, when it
  gives one. `Pinned` follows the variables the command reads. For the command named
  podman, it is true when `CONTAINER_HOST` or `CONTAINER_CONNECTION` is set and recorded.
  For any other command, it is true when `DOCKER_HOST` or `DOCKER_CONTEXT` is set and
  recorded; with neither set, it pins the context the command shows, `context show`, and
  `DOCKER_CONFIG`, else `~/.docker`, and a command whose `context show` fails is unpinned.
  A variable of the other kind stays recorded and never makes `Pinned` true. An address
  that cannot be read leaves the selection unpinned, and then neither the context nor the
  id is asked. Every engine command of `wall.Docker`'s, and the agent's container, then
  runs with the recorded selection in place of Forager's own; with an address left out,
  with Forager's own environment. `EngineID` asks the engine's id again through the
  recorded selection; a run whose engine gave none as it started asks once the enclosure
  is prepared, and records the answer. A walled run's registry entry records the engine.
  `wall.RunContainersExist` asks the engine's id again, when one is recorded, and then
  lists a run's containers with `ps --all --quiet --filter label=dev.qory.run=<id>`, with
  the recorded variables in place of Forager's own. It asks a command other than podman
  by its id, through its pinned selection, and refuses one recorded without an id, since
  podman installed under another name reads no `DOCKER_HOST` and every Docker engine gives
  an id; it asks the command named podman by its pinned selection when it gave no id, and
  refuses one recorded with neither.
- `wall.Binder` is a wall, or an enclosure, that binds files and directories of this
  machine of its own; `Binds` lists them as `wall.Bind` values, a `Pattern` for a
  directory the enclosure makes later. `wall.Docker` lists its helper and the pattern
  `wall.TempDirs()` before it prepares an enclosure; its enclosure lists the helper,
  the hook socket's directory and the private directory that holds the run's
  environment files and, with a CA, the `ca-bundle.pem` it binds, which it makes when
  it lists them. The session lists a wall's binds in the registry when the run starts,
  with the pattern of the runs' socket directories, and the enclosure's just before it
  binds them. A place that lies inside a writable directory another run's wall binds
  is `mount_shared_with_run`.

#### Changed

- The wall is `wall`.
- Behind a wall, the enclosure binds the outermost of the places a run lists, the
  mounts and the workspace, each once: a place inside another one of the same mode is
  reached through the outer one. The workspace is the working directory inside, through
  the mount that holds it, and is bound at its own path, writable, only when no mount
  holds it. `wall.Docker` binds `Launch.Mounts` and passes `Launch.Dir` as `--workdir`,
  and refuses a launch whose `Dir` no mount's path holds.

#### Fixed

- In an enclosure with a Docker of the agent's own, the agent's `docker` command reads
  its configuration, so the containers it starts get the proxy. `wall.Nest` made
  `/run/qory` root's with mode 0700, which the agent's user could not pass through: the
  command printed `WARNING: Error loading config file: open
  /run/qory/docker/config.json: permission denied`, and its containers reached nothing.
  `/run/qory` is now root's with mode 0755, whatever the umask, and a `/run/qory`
  already in the image is set to the same owner and mode; `/run/qory/docker` and its
  `config.json` stay the agent's, 0700 and 0600, now also whatever the umask or the
  image made them, and the file is written anew. A link where either directory goes is
  refused. An image that makes `/run/qory` 0755 to work around this may keep doing so.
- `wall.Nest` started `dockerd` with the run's environment, so the daemon looked for
  `containerd`, `runc` and `iptables` on the run's `PATH`, which may list a directory of
  the workspace, and ran what it found there as the enclosure's root; `LD_PRELOAD`,
  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `XTABLES_LIBDIR` and the `DOCKER_` variables reached it the same
  way. The daemon now runs with the system directories as its `PATH`, the proxy
  variables for its pulls and, when the run has a bundle, `SSL_CERT_FILE` pointing at
  it, and with nothing else; the agent keeps the run's environment. The conformance
  suite puts programs of these names first on the run's `PATH`, in the workspace, and
  requires that none of them runs.
- A run that sets `DOCKER_CONFIG` to an empty string gets the agent's docker
  configuration: `wall.Nest` added `DOCKER_CONFIG=/run/qory/docker` after the empty
  entry, the agent's `docker` command read the empty one as unset, and the containers it
  started got no proxy. The agent's environment now contains one `DOCKER_CONFIG`, the
  wall's, when the run's is unset or empty; a non-empty one stays as it is.

### Session

#### Upgrading

- A session speaks to a gateway alone, over the gateway's link. `session.Spec`
  gains `Gateway`, an interface: `session.LocalGateway(l link.Local)` from the link
  `(*gateway.Gateway).LocalLink()` hands out, or a `session.RemoteGateway` (Added,
  below); the link's secret stays in the process's memory, and a `session.Gateway`
  prints and logs by its socket or, behind a separate gateway, its URL, CA file and pin,
  never a secret. A spec without one, a nil `Gateway`, is no run. `Spec.Policy`, `Server`, `Local`, `AccessKey`, `InstanceID`,
  `InstanceName`, `Discovered`, `Credentials`, `Tools`, `Events`, `Heartbeat` and
  `ProxyBind` are removed, with `session.Policy`, `PolicyEgress`, `PolicyCredential`,
  `PolicyTool`, `Credential`, `Tool`, `Server`, `Discovery`, `ReadPolicy`,
  `(*Policy).Under`: the policy, the credentials, the tools and the server are
  `gateway.Config`'s, the stream that follows every event is `gateway.Config.Events`,
  the heartbeat interval is `gateway.Config.Heartbeat`, which the link's discovery
  announces, and the resend of the run's stream is the gateway's, `gateway.Resend`. What
  the entries below say of these members holds of the gateway's.
- `session.Resend` sends a run's record again to the separate gateway the run spoke to
  (Added, below). `ResendSpec` has `Gateway`, the run's `session.RemoteGateway`, `Dir`,
  `ForagerVersion` and `Report`, and no `Server`, `Wall` or `RunnerVersion`: a record on
  one machine is `gateway.Resend`'s, and what a wall left is the caller's to remove,
  `(*wall.Docker).Reap`. `Resend` returns a `ResendResult` value with `Sent`,
  `Undelivered`, `RunClosed`, `ClosedReason`, `State`, `Reason` and `NotOpened`, and no
  `RunID`, `Closed` or `Reaped`: the session completes no record.
- `session.Result.ClosedBy` and `session.ResendResult.ClosedBy` are removed: with
  Forager's gateway they always said `gateway`. `ResendResult.ClosedReason` is the code
  of the gateway's `410`, which `ResendResult.Reason` held before, and
  `ResendResult.Reason` is now the reason of how the run ended, as `Result.Reason` is.
- The session's own record is `session.jsonl` and `output.log` in the run directory;
  the gateway writes the run's numbered stream, `events.jsonl`, and its delivery state
  toward the server. Behind a separate gateway, the session's run directory on its own
  machine also holds `delivered.log`, what the gateway accepted of `session.jsonl` by the
  session's sequence, and `stopped` when the gateway ended the run, and `undelivered/`,
  the session's batches the gateway did not accept; neither holds the run credential.
  Behind a separate gateway alone, it also holds `run-secret`, the run's `run_secret`,
  mode 0600, written when the run opens and removed once nothing is owed.
  `Result.Undelivered` counts the session's events the gateway did not accept.
- A refusal the gateway or the server answers the run request with is a
  `*session.Refusal` with `From`, `gateway` or `apiary`, whose `Error` is the refusal's
  `message`, the text the run always returned; the gateway's `wall_required` is the
  error a run without a wall always had, word for word. A run the gateway could not open
  for a reason without a code is the error its answer's `message` says, word for word.
  `server.LinkRefusal` has `Message`, and the link's client sets a refusal's
  `accesskey.Refusal.Text` from it.
- A runtime name is a lower-case letter and then up to 63 lower-case letters, digits
  and dashes: `catalog.Lookup` refuses a longer name, `runtimetest.Conforms` fails a
  runtime that has one, and the descriptor schema holds `runtime` to the same bound.
- `session.Spec.Env` is what the run inherits. The values the harness computes itself go in
  `LaunchFixed`, the values its author wrote as defaults in `LaunchDefaults`, the run's own variables,
  `--env`, in `Variables.Run`, and the machine's, `wall.env`, in `Variables.Machine`, so
  the session tells each source apart and applies the highest that sets a name.
  `HarnessHome` is the harness's home as the agent sees it, an absolute path, and the
  session sets `QORY_HARNESS_HOME` to it. `OnVariables` receives each name, its source
  and the values that lost, once the variables are resolved and before the agent
  starts.
- A walled run refuses to pass into the enclosure a `QORY_` variable other than
  `QORY_RUN_ID` and `QORY_RUN_SOCKET`, or a variable a credential's `Env` names, with
  `variable_reserved`, whether it comes from `Env`, `LaunchFixed`, `LaunchDefaults`,
  `Variables.Run` or `Variables.Machine`. Any run refuses a value from any of them for a
  placeholder, `placeholder_conflict`. Both are checked before the variables are
  resolved. Behind a wall, every variable the runtime declares or reserves that neither
  a placeholder, a source nor the runtime's preparation sets is in the enclosure's
  environment as an empty value, for Claude Code `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
  `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` and `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`: a value the run passes for one
  reaches the runtime as before.
- With a server whose run configuration has a `security_policy`, `Spec.Policy` narrows
  it, where Forager ignored it before, so a caller may pass a policy of its own
  beside a server.
- The runtime prepares the launch before the tools start, since the names it sets are
  Forager's own when the variables are resolved.

#### Added

- `session.RemoteGateway{URL, CAFile, CertificateSHA256, Credential}`, a separate
  gateway on a machine of its own. The session reaches its one address over TLS 1.3
  alone, verifies the chain for the host name of `URL` against the system's roots or,
  with `CAFile`, that file's authorities alone, and the certificate's public key against
  `CertificateSHA256` when it is set, and sends `Authorization: Bearer` and the run
  credential `Credential` returns on every request, asked for again before each one, so
  a refreshed run credential is picked up. It holds no access key, prints as its URL,
  its `CAFile` and its pin, never the run credential, and without `Credential` is no
  run. The discovery's proxy is the gateway's one address, the run request carries the
  spec's labels and `about` and no narrowing, and `run_credential_refused`,
  `target_differs_from_credential` and `differs_from_credential` return a
  `*session.Refusal` with the gateway's message as its text. Agent traffic goes through
  the session's forwarder to the gateway's one address over TLS with the same trust:
  without a wall, the agent's proxy URL is the forwarder on loopback with the run's
  proxy secret as its password, so the agent's environment holds the proxy secret;
  behind a wall, the relay opens every connection with a token of the run's forwarder
  alone, `wall.Launch.ProxyToken`, which the forwarder checks and replaces with the
  run's proxy secret inside TLS, so the proxy secret is in no file of the wall's.
- `session.Resend(ctx, session.ResendSpec)` sends a separate gateway what a run's session
  did not deliver to it, from the run directory on the session's machine, through the
  run's `RemoteGateway` with its run credential. Every event of `session.jsonl` the link
  takes that `delivered.log` does not name is posted in order, in the link's batches,
  until the gateway accepts it or the context ends, and what it does not accept is under
  `undelivered/` again, unless the gateway ended the run; the events the session records in its own record alone are not
  sent. Every batch carries the run's `run_secret` from `run-secret`, which is removed
  once nothing is owed. A record that owes nothing is sent nothing, with no request, and
  the result is the zero `ResendResult`. A record with no
  `delivered.log`, of a run that never opened at the gateway, a run refused at its run
  request say, is `NotOpened`, left as it is and sent nothing, with no request. A run
  the gateway has ended answers with its `410`:
  `RunClosed`, with `ClosedReason`, and nothing more is sent. Once something was sent,
  `State` and `Reason` say how the run ended where that is known: the state and the
  reason the gateway's `410` says, as the session records them, else those of the
  record's `dev.qory.run.exited`. The `dev.qory.run.exited` the session posted is sent
  again; the one it records after the gateway ended the run is the session's alone, and
  is never sent: `delivered.log` says `stopped` before it, whether the `410` answered a
  batch or a reload. The gateway's
  `401` `run_credential_refused`, which an expired run credential gets at the discovery,
  and its `403` `target_differs_from_credential` and `differs_from_credential` are a
  `*session.Refusal` from `gateway`, the events left under `undelivered/`. A record its
  session holds is `session.ErrRunning`, and a directory with `events.jsonl` is a
  gateway's record. After a gateway restart, the session's undelivered events get the
  `401` and stay in the run directory, and the gateway's own resend completes the run
  `gateway_lost`.
- `Result.RunClosed` and `Result.ClosedReason`: a run the gateway closed, by a `410` on
  the gateway's link or the gateway's `400` to a batch, says with what code,
  `run_closed`, `credential_expired`, `stopped`, `credential_check_unreachable` or
  `credential_check_invalid`. The runtime is stopped as at its time limit, and the
  session's record has `dev.qory.run.exited` with the state and the reason the `410`
  says, such as `cancelled` and `no_longer_needed`, and the runtime's own exit status:
  `batch_refused` as the reason after a refused batch, and `failed` with the code as
  the reason when the `410` carries no state, or one the schema refuses. A run the
  gateway closed before its runtime started is a `*session.Refusal` with the code,
  status `410` and the text `the run did not start: it has ended already`, and records
  `dev.qory.run.refused` as before.
- `Result.State` and `Result.Reason` say how the run ended, as the session's
  `dev.qory.run.exited` does. Behind a separate gateway, a runtime that exits by itself
  asks the gateway once for the outcome its starter gave, before `dev.qory.run.exited`
  is written, and waits at most about 10 seconds: an outcome sets the state and the
  reason, such as `failed` and `checks_failed` for a runtime that exited 0, whose
  `exit_code` stays 0; a reserved reason, or one that is not a code, is dropped alone,
  the state kept, and the heartbeats go on while it waits. Once the runtime has exited,
  the caller's context ending cuts neither the ask nor the record short: the answer
  still decides, `dev.qory.run.exited` is still written and posted, and `Run` returns
  after them, within their bounds; the gateway closing the run still ends the ask.
  With `{}`, an answer that is not valid, a refusal or no answer in time, the exit
  decides, `succeeded` on 0 and `failed` otherwise, and nothing is added to the record
  or reported. A run stopped at its time limit, by the caller's context or
  by the gateway asks nothing, and a run on the local link never asks or waits. A run
  whose caller's context had ended when the runtime's exit was observed, a Ctrl-C or a
  signal to the caller, is `cancelled` with `interrupted`, in the record, on the link
  and in the result, with the runtime's own `exit_code` and `signal`, whatever they
  are. At the time limit the run is `cancelled` with `timeout`, `Result.TimedOut`, when
  the session's stop signal reached the runtime before its exit was observed; a
  runtime that exited by itself before it is decided by its exit, whatever its status.
  A runtime that exits 0 at the session's stop, at the context's end or at the limit,
  has exited 0: `session.Run` records its `dev.qory.run.exited` and returns its result,
  where it returned the context's error and recorded no `dev.qory.run.exited`.
  `Result.Cancelled`, beside `Result.TimedOut`, says the caller's context had ended
  when the session observed the runtime's exit, whoever stopped the runtime; a context
  that ends after the exit, while the gateway is asked or the sinks close, leaves it
  false, as do the time limit, `Result.TimedOut`, a run the gateway closed first,
  `Result.RunClosed`, and a signal from elsewhere: it is never true with either.
  When it is true, `dev.qory.run.exited` is `cancelled` with `interrupted`.
- The session fetches the run's configuration from the gateway again whenever the
  gateway's answers carry a new run-configuration digest, and records it in another
  `dev.qory.run.policy_applied`.
- A run configuration's `variables` reach the agent's process: for each name an object
  with its string `value`, as the server resolved it. An attribute beside `value` is
  ignored. For each name the run takes the value of the highest source that sets it: the
  fixed names, those the session, the proxy, the wall, the runtime's preparation and the
  placeholders set and the values the harness computes; then the server's; the run's
  own; the machine's; the harness's written defaults; and what the run inherits. The
  deny list, which is `denied-variables.json`, the runtime's `denies` and
  `Variables.Deny`, matched regardless of case with `*` for any run of characters,
  leaves out a value of the server, the run, the machine or the harness's defaults; its
  built-in entries leave out a value the harness computes too. The server's value of a
  variable the runtime declares or reserves, or of one a credential is read from, is
  left out. A run without a wall takes none of the server's variables unless
  `Variables.Unwalled` is `accept`; the run's own apply with or without a wall. A value
  that loses is left out and the run starts. The variables are fixed when the run
  starts. Tools, the relay, the agent's Docker daemon and the wall's `docker` command
  keep their own environment.
- `runtimes.Secrets` is the optional interface of a runtime that declares the secrets it
  needs; a descriptor's runtime implements it. `wall.Setter` is the optional interface
  of a wall that sets variables in the enclosure itself, and `wall.Docker` implements
  it.
- A runtime descriptor defines the secrets the runtime needs, under an optional
  `secrets`: `declares`, each secret with its id, title, variable, exact hosts, optional
  paths and scheme; `one_of`, groups of declarations of which the runtime needs at most
  one, and exactly one of a required group; `reserves`; `denies`; and
  `credential_files`. Behind a wall, a declared or reserved variable that nothing sets
  goes in empty. It also has an optional `title`. `auth.schema.json` defines the
  scheme, `bearer`, `header` or `basic`. Forager checks the secrets when it reads a
  descriptor.
- The Claude Code descriptor declares its model credential: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, set as
  `x-api-key`, or `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, set as a bearer, on `api.anthropic.com`
  under `/v1/`, one of the two required. It reserves `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, denies the
  variables that move its requests, credential, shell, settings or TLS trust, and lists
  `~/.claude/.credentials.json`.
- A runtime declares its secrets in Go through `runtimes.Secrets`, an optional interface
  checked by type assertion, whose `Secrets` method returns `runtimes.Declarations`: the
  declarations, the `one_of` groups, and the reserved, denied and credential-file lists
  of a descriptor's `secrets`. A described runtime implements it with a copy of its
  descriptor's section, empty when the descriptor has none; a runtime without it
  declares nothing. `runtimes.Declaration`, `runtimes.Group` and `runtimes.Auth` are the
  parts.
- `runtimes.Attach` has `Placeholders`: behind a wall, the variables the enclosure gets
  the placeholder value in, a credential's and a tool's. `runtimes.Placeholder` is that
  value.
- Interactive Claude Code runs with an API key behind a wall. On a pseudo-terminal,
  Claude Code waits for a person to approve the key in `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` unless its
  configuration lists the key's last 20 characters under
  `customApiKeyResponses.approved`. When the session is interactive and
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is a placeholder of the run, the `claude-settings` installer
  writes `approve-key.sh` into the run directory and starts Claude Code through it with
  `/bin/sh`, which such an image contains: the script adds the placeholder value's
  entry, `utside-the-enclosure`, to `~/.claude.json`, or to the file Claude Code reads
  in its place, inside the enclosure, and then starts Claude Code. A missing file
  becomes one with the entry alone, mode 0600; an empty one gets the entry and keeps its
  mode. A JSON object without `customApiKeyResponses` gets the entry as its first
  member, and keeps every member and the bytes before and after its opening brace,
  ending in one newline. Any other file, and a path that is neither a regular file nor
  missing, stays as it is. The script writes to a temporary file beside the
  configuration first and copies it over, through a link when the configuration is one;
  whatever fails, the configuration keeps its content and Claude Code starts. The OAuth
  credential, and every headless session, start Claude Code as before.
- No tool, credential program or agent receives `QORY_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET`,
  `QORY_ACCESS_KEY_ID` or `QORY_APIARY_PUBLIC_KEY`: the session leaves them out of every
  environment it starts a program with. Nor does an agent, walled or not, receive
  `QORY_RUN_CREDENTIAL_SECRET`, whatever brought it.
- `session.Spec` has `Discovered`, called once the server's signed configuration
  document is read and before the registration, with the access key's `node_id` and whether the
  document lists `secrets`; an error it returns is no run.
- A walled run refuses a mount, or the workspace, that is, contains or lies inside one of
  Forager's files, `mount_contains_forager_files`, before it contacts the server and
  before anything starts, `Local` included. `session.Spec` has `ForagerFiles`, the
  absolute paths the caller lists as its own, such as the directory of qory's
  `forager.yaml`. Beside them the session checks the directory of every credential and tool
  program the machine defines, the file a credential is read from, the private directories
  of every run's tool sockets, record sockets (`qory-run-*`) and Docker wall environment
  files (`qory-wall-*`) in the system's temporary directory, and the files a wall lists
  through the new `wall.Filer`: `wall.Docker` lists the directory of the `docker` command,
  of the helper, and the command's configuration directory. The refusal's `Names` are the
  mount and Forager's file, in that order. `session.Overlap` returns how a mount and a
  path stand, `is`, `contains` or `lies inside`, after symbolic links and by whole
  components, with the filesystem judging which directories are the same, case and bind
  mounts included. A link whose target does not exist yet is followed to the target, a
  path that cannot be resolved is no run, and the check runs again just before the
  enclosure is built.
- No walled run binds from a place a walled agent of the same user can change: no name on
  the way to a bind source is looked up in a writable bind, the run's own or another
  walled run's still going, or in a directory inside one. A walled run is refused with
  `mount_mode_conflict` when a mount, or the workspace, lies inside another one of the
  run's, or is the same, of the other mode; `Names` holds the inner path and the outer
  one, as passed. It is refused with `mount_through_link` when a mount, or the workspace,
  of either mode, goes through a link inside a writable place of the run's and does not
  resolve into it, since the agent that writes the link would choose what is bound;
  `Names` holds the place as passed, the link's path and the writable place as passed. It
  is refused with `mount_shared_with_run` when one of its binds lies inside a writable
  bind of another walled run still going, apart from the same root, or is reached through
  one; when one of its writable binds holds a bind of such a run, or a directory a name on
  the way to one is looked up in; or when one of its binds is, holds or lies inside such a
  run's run directory, whatever the modes. `Names` holds this run's path, the other run's
  id and the other run's path, each as its run passed it. Two runs that bind the same root
  run side by side, and two read-only binds never conflict. A run whose own helper, or
  another directory of Forager's its wall binds, lies inside a writable bind of such a
  run, or is reached through one, does not start. The session keeps the walled runs still
  going in a registry of its own, per user, `$XDG_STATE_HOME/qory-forager/walled`, else
  `~/.local/state/qory-forager/walled`, 0700: a file per run, named by its run id, with
  its process id and its binds, each as passed, as resolved, with the entries its names
  are looked up as, whether writable, and what it is when it is not a place; the file is
  held locked for the run's life and removed when it ends, kept when the wall could not be
  removed. A file whose lock is free is the run of a session that is gone: it is still
  going while the container engine its entry records holds a container labelled with its
  run id, in any state, and is removed when the engine holds none. A run that cannot ask
  that engine, whose engine answers with another id than the one recorded, or that reads
  such an entry that records no id for a command other than podman, neither a pinned
  selection nor an id for podman, no engine, or that cannot be read, is refused with
  `engine_unreachable`; `Names` holds the earlier run's id and then the absolute path of
  its registry entry, and the sentence reads "Docker could not be asked whether the walled
  run <id> is still going, so the run does not start: <the error>". A bind of another
  run's, or a directory on the way to it, that is gone is compared by its names, like a
  part that does not exist yet; any other failure to resolve one stops the run. A run
  checks its binds and adds its own entry under a lock of the registry's, before it
  contacts the server, and again, with its wall's own binds, just before the enclosure
  binds them. `events/run.refused.schema.json` lists the four codes.
- The session passes every bind's path clean, and a run whose working directory lies in
  none of its binds fails.
- A run refused with a code is a `session.Refusal`, with the code and the server's
  status: `apiary_public_key_missing` for a server without a pin, before any request;
  `unauthorized` for a `401`; `answer_unsigned` for an answer that does not verify; and
  `instance_limit` when the node's live instances are at its limit.

#### Changed

- The session is `session`, with `session/runtimes/…` (from `runtimes/…`) and
  `session/internal/…`.
- `Spec.RunsDir` and the registry of walled runs are among Forager's files, so a
  walled run's mount, or workspace, that is, contains or lies inside either one is
  `mount_contains_forager_files`, and so is a writable one that holds a directory a name
  on the way to one of Forager's files is looked up in, a link say. A walled run's
  run directory lies outside every place it binds and is reached through none, and the
  agent can neither change nor move its record. The default runs directory,
  `.qory/runs` in the workspace, lies inside the workspace, so a walled run passes one
  outside it.
- The check of a walled run's places runs again just before the enclosure binds them,
  the registry included. A place that resolves otherwise than at the start, or whose
  names are looked up in other directories, fails the run with a sentence that says
  which.
- The registry of walled runs is `$XDG_STATE_HOME/qory-forager/walled`, else
  `~/.local/state/qory-forager/walled`. `session.Spec` has `ForagerVersion` and
  `ForagerFiles`. `runtimes.CheckStopSignal` checks a stop signal and
  `runtimes.StopSignal` returns the signal of its name; `session.CheckStopSignal` calls
  the first.

### e2e and CI

#### Upgrading

- An image passed to `e2e.Run` with `Docker` needs the `docker` command as well as
  `dockerd`: the suite starts a container with it as the agent's user.
- `e2e.Options` has `Recorders`: three `e2e.Recorder` values, each the helper
  started with `e2e.RecorderArgs` and `e2e.RecorderEnv()` in a container of
  its own, in this order: the host of a runtime's API key, the host of its OAuth
  credential, then a host the policy allows with no credential. A `Recorder` holds the
  `Host` the proxy reaches it on and a `Recorded` function that returns the content of
  `e2e.RecorderFile` in its container. An adapter's test that passes none skips
  the checks of a runtime's key, `QORY_WALL_REQUIRE` turns those skips into failures,
  and a number other than none or three fails the suite. A recorder prints
  `e2e.RecorderReady` once it listens, and `e2e.AwaitRecorder` waits for that
  line in its container's log, and fails with the log at once when the container stops
  first; a recorder's container started without `--rm` keeps that log. With
  `Recorders`, `e2e.Run` points the roots of the process, and the programs it
  starts within `Run`, at the suite's authority alone, with `SSL_CERT_FILE` and
  `SSL_CERT_DIR`. The process reads its roots once, at its first verification of a
  certificate, so the test binary's first verification must come within `Run`; from
  then on, for the rest of the process, it trusts only the suite's authority.
  `TestDockerConforms` starts the recorders from `busybox:stable`.

#### Added

- The wall's conformance suite checks a runtime's two credentials from inside the
  enclosure, as Claude Code sends them: an API key in `x-api-key` and an OAuth
  credential as a bearer, each a fake key for a recorder that acts as its host. Each key
  reaches its own host once, in its own header and in place of the stand-in; another
  allowed host, plainly and through a tunnel, receives the stand-ins and no key; the
  probe's environment and every `/proc/*/environ` it reads contain the stand-ins and no
  key; and the run's directory, output and reports contain no key, after the
  interactive run as well. The suite points its own process's roots at an authority of
  its own with `SSL_CERT_FILE` and `SSL_CERT_DIR`, so the proxy verifies the
  recorders. The proxy's tests cover both schemes as well, with a request that carries
  both stand-ins.
- `TestDockerClaudeCodeThroughTheWall` runs Claude Code itself behind the Docker
  adapter, with `QORY_WALL_CLAUDE_IMAGE` set to an image with `claude` on its `PATH`:
  `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` points it at a recorder that answers as the Messages API, once
  with an API key and once with an OAuth credential. Claude Code prints the recorder's
  answer, each request carries the fake key in the credential's header and no stand-in,
  and the record lists one request through the proxy for each the recorder received,
  each to the recorder.
- `TestDockerClaudeCodeThroughTheWall` also runs Claude Code interactively, on a
  pseudo-terminal with a home of its own whose configuration has the onboarding done and
  the workspace trusted, with the API key and with the OAuth credential. The test types
  a prompt once Claude Code shows its input and leaves with `/exit`; with the API key,
  Claude Code reaches its input with no approval prompt for the key, and the
  configuration then holds the placeholder value's entry and every member it held
  before. Every run sets `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` and the other credential's variable
  empty, and the recorder receives the chosen credential's header alone, so Claude Code
  reads an empty variable as unset and uses the placeholder.

#### Changed

- The wall's conformance suite is package `e2e`, from `wall/walltest`. CI runs gofmt,
  vet, the tests, the build and revive in one job per part, `core`, `gateway`, `wall`,
  `session` and `e2e`; the job named `Go tests` passes when they all pass; and the two
  wall conformance jobs run `./e2e`. A test in `internal/importrules` holds each part's
  imports to the rules: the core imports no part; the gateway and the wall import the
  core; the session imports the core and the wall, and its tests package `gateway`,
  using only its surface; and only `e2e` imports the session.

#### Fixed

- The wall's conformance suite missed that the agent's `docker` command could not read
  its configuration: the containers it starts through the Engine API receive the relay's
  address. It also starts one with the image's `docker`
  command, as the agent's user and with no proxy setting of its own, and requires it to
  reach the origin through the proxy and nothing else, so the image of
  `TestDockerNestedConforms` contains the docker command as well as dockerd.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-28

### Upgrading

- `golang.org/x/sys` is a direct dependency.

### Added

- Images: `session.Spec.Images` defines the images of the machine's, a name, a
  reference, the container runtime the wall starts it under and whether the agent gets a
  Docker daemon of its own, and a policy's `image` selects one by name, as it selects
  credentials and tools. `Spec.Image` is the default when the policy selects none: the
  name of one of `Images`, or a reference. A name the machine does not define, a
  selection without a wall, an image defined twice and a daemon without a runtime are no
  run; a reload that selects another image is refused, where another image is the one
  the selection resolves to, so selecting the machine's default by name, or dropping
  that selection, is no change.
- `dev.qory.run.started` contains `image_name`, `container_runtime` and `docker`, and
  `dev.qory.run.policy_applied` contains `image`, when they apply; `image` in
  `run.started` is the reference the selection resolves to.
- `wall.Request` has `Runtime` and `Docker`, and `wall.Docker` has `NestArgs`, the
  helper's arguments for the mode that calls `wall.Nest`, beside the one that calls
  `wall.Relay`. The Docker adapter refuses an image with `Docker` when `NestArgs` is
  empty.
- A Docker of the agent's own, experimental because whether the enclosure's root reaches
  the mounts the run lists as the machine's root has not been verified: it may change or
  be withdrawn in a minor release. An image with `Docker` starts under its `Runtime`,
  `sysbox-runc`, whose root is a user of the machine's that is not root. The enclosure
  starts as that root, with `no-new-privileges` and a volume of the run's for the
  daemon's store; `wall.Nest`, the helper in a hidden mode, starts `dockerd` on its Unix
  socket alone with the socket in the agent's group, waits until it answers, writes the
  agent a docker configuration that points the containers it starts at the proxy's
  address, drops every capability, the bounding set included, and executes the launch as
  the agent's user, with the inheritable and ambient sets cleared. It refuses a runtime
  that maps the enclosure's root to the machine's, and looks for `dockerd` only in the
  image's system directories. The daemon's store is a volume of the run's, removed with
  the enclosure and bounded only by the engine's disk, and a daemon that exits stays
  stopped for the rest of the run. Docker in Docker with `--privileged` and the machine's
  socket stay refused.
- IP forwarding is off in the relay's namespace, for IPv4 and IPv6: the relay connects
  the enclosure's network to the ordinary one only through the proxy.
- The wall's conformance suite runs in an enclosure with a Docker of the agent's own,
  `TestDockerNestedConforms`, with the runtime set in `QORY_WALL_RUNTIME`; the CI job
  installs Sysbox and runs it.

- Tools: programs of the machine's that serve hosts, for what a run reaches that needs
  more than a secret in a header. `session.Spec.Tools` defines them, a name, a command
  with `${argument}`, the pattern the argument must match, the hosts the tool serves and
  its placeholders, and a policy's `tools` selects among them, by name and argument, as
  it selects credentials. Behind a wall the runner starts each selected tool outside the
  enclosure before the runtime, with `QORY_TOOL_LISTEN` set to the Unix socket it
  listens on, `QORY_RUN_ID` set to the run's id, and the runner's environment minus the
  variables the machine's credentials are read from, and stops its process group when
  the run ends. The proxy ends the session's TLS for the hosts a tool serves, decides
  the host and the path by the policy, and passes every request it lets through to the
  tool over the socket, streamed, with `Qory-Request-Id` and `Qory-Path-Rule` set,
  `none` for a path observed that no rule covers. Every header and trailer of the
  `Qory-` prefix the session sent, in any case or with an underscore, is taken off, and
  the proxy's headers stay on the request when the session lists them in `Connection`. A
  host a tool serves need not exist: the proxy never dials it, so a service with no host
  of its own, such as an MCP server, serves a name under `.internal`. A selection
  without a wall, a tool that does not listen within a minute, a host a tool and a
  credential both claim, and under enforce a host the allow list does not cover are no
  run; a reload that selects other tools is refused. The runner knows no protocol:
  signing a request to an object store is a tool's, not a scheme's.
- Every request to a tool's host is one `dev.qory.run.egress` with `tool`, the tool's
  name; an allowed one is a tool invocation. `dev.qory.run.policy_applied` lists the
  run's `tools` and their hosts among `terminated`.
- Every egress event that is one request, a plain one or one inside a terminated
  connection, contains `request_id`, the proxy's own id of it, and `status`, the status
  the host or the tool returned, when one returned.
- The wall's conformance suite reaches a tool from inside the enclosure: on its paths it
  receives the proxy's headers and not the ones the probe forged, and off them the proxy
  refuses.
- Each credential use and each tool in `dev.qory.run.policy_applied` contains
  `argument`, the argument the policy passed to the credential or the tool, when it
  passed one, so an audit of the record reads which repositories a secret was minted for
  and what each tool was started for.

### Changed

- Contract `v1` revision 1 is amended in place again, before any server relied on it:
  the policy may contain `tools` and `image`, and the events contain the fields listed
  under Added. The runner sends `X-Qory-Contract-Version: 1` and `contract_version: 1`,
  as before.
- The contract's wording is plainer: the README, the schemas' descriptions and the
  fixtures' notes use plain verbs in the present tense. The runner's behaviour is the
  same; where the text disagreed with the runner it now describes what the runner does.
- A wall points `AWS_CA_BUNDLE` at the run's bundle as well, beside `SSL_CERT_FILE`,
  `GIT_SSL_CAINFO`, `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`, `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` and `CURL_CA_BUNDLE`.
  The AWS CLI and botocore read `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` only when neither `AWS_CA_BUNDLE`
  nor `ca_bundle` in the image's AWS configuration is set, so an image that sets a
  bundle of its own there did not trust a terminated host. A caller that sets its own
  variables in `Docker.CAEnv` gets those, as before.
- The contract states that a path rule reads the request's path alone: its query,
  headers and body are outside the rule. A subresource in the query, a listing's prefix,
  a copy's source in a header and a GraphQL body are outside what a rule checks.
- A policy's credential and tool `argument` may have up to 4096 characters, where it had
  256, so one argument can list several repositories, `acme/shop,acme/lib`. The cap
  bounds only the size of the run's record: what guards the argument is the definition's
  pattern, which must match it whole, and it reaches the program as one word, with no
  shell.

### Removed

- The paths kept for what a runner before 0.5.1 left: sending a record again no longer
  reads an `ai.qory.` type as `dev.qory.`, and a reap no longer looks for containers and
  networks labelled `ai.qory.run`. No runner or server is in use yet, so there is no
  such record or container to read.

### Fixed

- A request's trailer reaches the host of a terminated connection. The proxy passed on a
  copy of the trailer made before the body was read, which was empty, so a client that
  sent a checksum as a trailer sent none upstream.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-09-24

### Upgrading

- A receiver that matched on `ai.qory.*` matches `dev.qory.*`: every event type is
  renamed, `ai.qory.run.started` to `dev.qory.run.started` and so on, and its data is
  as it was. A server's configuration document names the types it wants in
  `events.types` under the new names, and a descriptor of your own names its session
  types `dev.qory.session.*`; the schemas refuse the old names.
- The contract stays `v1` revision 1, amended in place, and the runner sends
  `X-Qory-Contract-Version: 1` as before. Nothing else changes.

### Changed

- Contract `v1` revision 1 is amended in place again, before any server relied on it:
  every event type starts `dev.qory.`, where it started `ai.qory.`. A CloudEvents type
  is named under the reverse-DNS name of whoever defines it, and qory.dev roots every
  identifier of the contract, as it roots the schema URLs,
  `https://qory.dev/contracts/runner/v1/...`. The schemas, the fixtures and the Claude
  Code descriptor carry the new names, and the signed batch fixtures are signed again
  over their new bodies.
- The containers and the networks of a wall carry the label `dev.qory.run`, where they
  carried `ai.qory.run`.
- Sending again the record of a runner before 0.5.1 reads its `ai.qory.` types as
  `dev.qory.` ones: its `run.exited` is found, so the record is not closed twice, and
  the server gets each event under the type of today. The file keeps what was written.
  The reap that goes with it removes what carries either label.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-24

### Upgrading

- A caller in Go that serves the run configuration through `receiver.Handler` changes
  its hook: `RunConfiguration` is `func(labels map[string]string) ([]byte, string, bool)`,
  where it was `func(forge, repository string)`. The map is every label of the run, from
  the request's query or the run's `ai.qory.run.started`, and empty when there were
  none; where a hook read `forge` and `repository`, it reads `labels["forge"]` and
  `labels["repository"]`, which are empty when the run has no such label, as before.
- A server of your own finds every label of a run on the run configuration request,
  where it found `forge` and `repository`. One that reads only those two parameters
  needs no change; one that refused any other parameter accepts them now, or refuses
  the runs that carry more labels. A query of the longest labels is 13,343 bytes, which a front end that
  limits the request line to 8 KiB refuses.
- Nothing changes for the `qory` command, which labels a run with `forge` and
  `repository` and finds its policy chosen by them as before.

### Changed

- Contract `v1` revision 1 is amended in place, before any server relied on it: the run
  configuration request carries every label of the run as its query, one parameter per
  label, sorted by key and percent-encoded,
  `?forge=github.com&issue=77&repository=acme%2Fshop`, where 0.4 sent `forge` and
  `repository` alone. The change adds: a server that reads only those two finds them as
  before. Which labels name what a run works on is the server's to decide; the runner
  reads nothing into them. The contract states the bound, at most 13,343 bytes of query
  from sixteen labels, so a server knows the longest request line it can get. The
  revision stays 1. A signed fixture of the form with every label,
  `fixtures/signed/get-run-configuration-labels-valid.json`, beside the one of two.
- The runner sends the run's labels, all of them, on every run configuration request,
  at the start and at each reload, and a label with an empty value as `key=`.
- `receiver.Handler` reads the run configuration request's query as the run's labels
  and hands them all to `RunConfiguration`, and keeps each run's labels from its
  `ai.qory.run.started` whole, so the digest an answer to a delivery carries is the one
  for all of them. A query that is not labels, a key sent twice, a key outside the
  grammar, a value over 256 bytes or not UTF-8, or more than sixteen, is a `400` once
  the request verifies, and the hook does not see it.
- The rule for labels, `session.CheckLabels` and `session.MaxLabels`, is one definition
  the runner and the receiver share.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- A policy reload that landed in the moment between a tunnel's `200 Connection
  Established` and the proxy's own list of open tunnels missed that tunnel, and left it
  open to a host the new policy denies. The tunnel is on the list before the client hears
  200.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-21

### Upgrading

- The server replaces the webhook. `session.Spec.Webhook` is gone; `Spec.Server` is a
  `*session.Server` with `Version`, `URL`, `AccessKey` and `Secret`, the document of
  `server.schema.json`: the server's origin and nothing after it, the key the server
  knows the runner by, and the secret that signs. `ResendSpec.Server` likewise. For
  `qory`, the file's `server` section replaces `webhook`, and `QORY_SERVER_SECRET`
  replaces `QORY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Where a webhook took an endpoint, a server is an
  origin: the runner fetches `/.well-known/qory-configuration` under it, signed, and
  learns the events URL and the filter there.
- A receiver of your own implements the contract's server section: discovery, the
  events endpoint, and the two headers on every request, `X-Qory-Access-Key` and
  `X-Qory-Contract-Version`. A `GET` is signed over a canonical string with a
  timestamp; a `POST` over its body as before. Every authentication failure is `401`
  with `{"error":"unauthorized"}`. `internal/receiver` is now the public package
  `receiver`; its `Handler` takes `Keys`, a lookup of an access key to its secrets,
  in place of `Secret`, and is replayed against `contracts/runner/v1/fixtures/signed/`.
- The contract is `v1` revision 1: `X-Qory-Contract-Version: 1` on every request and
  `contract_version: 1` in the ping's data, required. A runner that sends neither is
  revision 0.
- `ai.qory.run.policy_applied`: `declared` is renamed `harness_hosts`, and the narrowing
  is gone: `allow` is the policy's list, and a host the harness declared that the policy
  does not cover is denied under `enforce` like any other. `source` gains `fetched`,
  with `url` and `run_configuration`.
- `ai.qory.run.egress` requires `outcome`: `connected`, `dial_failed` or `refused`.
- A name that resolves to the runner's own machine or to the link-local range, through
  a guarded proxy, is now answered `403` and recorded as denied with the rule
  `wall:own-address`; it was a `502` recorded as allowed.
- `runtimes.Runtime` gains `Headless(args []string) bool`, so a `Runtime` of one's own
  adds the method; returning false keeps what the caller asked for.
- A receiver accepts one more type, `ai.qory.run.resized`, with `cols` and `rows`, and
  `terminal`, an object of `cols` and `rows`, on `ai.qory.run.started` when
  `interactive` is true. A receiver that replays the terminal takes the size from
  `run.started` and changes it at each `run.resized`. A receiver that cut the terminal
  stream into lines itself finds a chunk is now a redraw, not a line: it splits on
  nothing, or on what it wants to.

### Added

- The server, `session.Server`: the runner as a client of one server contract. At start
  it fetches the server's configuration document with a signed `GET`, posts the ping and
  every batch to the events URL the document names, with the access key beside the
  signature, and when the document names a `run` section, fetches the run configuration
  for the run's `forge` and `repository` labels and takes its `security_policy` as the
  run's policy, source `fetched`. A fetch that fails, a document the schema refuses or
  a ping not accepted is no run, and the error names the URL and the status. `--local`
  contacts no server.
- Reload. Every answer to a batch may carry `X-Qory-Configuration` and
  `X-Qory-Run-Configuration`; a digest that differs from what the run holds has the
  runner fetch the document again. A new run configuration takes effect for new
  connections at once, the record gets a second `ai.qory.run.policy_applied` at the
  sequence where it took effect, a tunnel open to a host the new policy denies is
  closed and recorded as a denied `ai.qory.run.egress` with `outcome: refused`, and a
  host the new policy terminates TLS for is terminated on its next connection. A new
  configuration document swaps the events URL and the filter for later batches. One
  reload runs at a time; answers during one are coalesced into the next.
- A reload is as strict as a start. The fetched policy's `credentials` are resolved
  again, as at the start, and go to the proxy in one step with the policy; a terminated
  connection whose credential changed is closed, so no later request carries one the
  new policy does not select. What a start refuses, a credential that does not resolve
  or one selected without a wall, fails the reload: it is reported and the policy in
  force stays. A run configuration the server answered is fetched once per answered
  digest: a document that is the one in force changes nothing, and one that was
  refused is not asked for again until the answer changes; a fetch the server did not
  answer is tried again on the next answer.
- The client follows no redirect, its own or a caller's `http.Client` alike: a 3xx is
  a status like any other, no run at discovery and a retry for a delivery, so the
  access key, the signature and the timestamp never reach a host a redirect names.
- `receiver.Handler` serves the three endpoints with `Configuration`,
  `RunConfiguration`, `Now`, `Window`, `EventsPath` and `RunPath`, answers the digest
  headers, verifies in constant time, looks a key up only after its shape is checked
  and logs nothing about the headers.
- The contract: `server.schema.json`, `configuration.schema.json`,
  `run-configuration.schema.json`; fixtures under `fixtures/server/`,
  `fixtures/configuration/`, `fixtures/run-configuration/` and `fixtures/signed/`, the
  last with real signatures under the published key `ak_f1xt0re000000000` and secret
  `fixture-secret-not-a-real-one`; the section §The server with the canonical string,
  its known answers, the failure rule, the documents, the reload rules and the modes
  of a run; `contracts.Revision`.
- The pseudo-terminal's size in the record, so a replay can lay the redraws of a
  full-screen program over each other: `terminal` on `ai.qory.run.started`, the columns
  and rows the runtime started on, the runner's own terminal's when it has one and 80 by
  24 otherwise; and `ai.qory.run.resized` with the new size at the sequence where the
  runner's terminal was resized and the pseudo-terminal followed, so the chunks after it
  were drawn on the new size. Neither on pipes. Behind the docker wall a resize reaches
  the container's terminal: the docker command runs on the runner's pseudo-terminal,
  takes the resize signal and resizes the container's. The schema
  `events/run.resized.schema.json`; the recorded run under `fixtures/run/` carries both.
- `egress.deny` in the policy: hosts the session may not reach, in `allow`'s grammar,
  in either mode. The proxy decides it first, after the wall's guard and before the
  mode and the allow list: a host an entry covers is refused with a `403`, not
  dialled, recorded as denied with the entry as its rule, under `observe` as under
  `enforce`, whatever `allow` says of it; `allow: ["*.example"]` with
  `deny: ["tracker.example"]` denies `tracker.example` and reaches `api.example`.
  Observe records every connection and denies only what `deny` names. A reload
  carries the list and closes an open tunnel to a host the new one names.
  `ai.qory.run.policy_applied` carries `deny` beside `allow`, the policy's entries.
  `session.PolicyEgress.Deny`; `Under` keeps the deny lists of a policy and its
  ceiling both, whatever their modes, since a deny narrows. Fixtures
  `fixtures/policy/observe-deny.yaml` and `fixtures/run-configuration/observe-deny.json`.
  Revision 1 of the contract is amended in place; it had not shipped.
- `headless` in the descriptor: `args`, the arguments that mean the runtime runs
  without an interface. When one of them is among the arguments the runtime is started
  with, the session runs on pipes even at a terminal, exactly as if the caller had
  asked for that: `ai.qory.run.started` carries `interactive: false` and no `terminal`,
  and the descriptor's `output` source is read. A short argument matches the whole
  token, a long one the token or its `--name=value` form, and nothing else is
  inferred; absent, the caller alone decides. Runtimes differ in how they say "no
  interface", so the descriptor defines the inference and not the command. The Claude
  Code descriptor names `-p` and `--print`, so `claude -p "…"` at a terminal is a
  headless session with no flag to say so. `session.Spec.Interactive` keeps its
  meaning, what the caller has; `runtimes.Runtime.Headless` is what the runtime says
  of the arguments, false from a bare runtime. The invalid fixture
  `descriptor-headless-empty.yaml`.

### Changed

- The terminal stream is chunked at 4096 bytes or at a quiet gap of 50 ms after the
  runtime's last write, whichever comes first, never inside a multibyte character, and a
  line break no longer cuts it. A full-screen program redraws on every keypress, and cut
  at line breaks an interactive session was thousands of `ai.qory.run.log` chunks of a
  few bytes each; now one redraw is one chunk. A stream that never pauses is cut at 4096
  bytes, and what is held when the runtime exits is the last chunk. Pipes keep the rule
  of one line or 4096 bytes. `chunk.NewTerminal` is the writer; `chunk.New` is the
  pipes'.

- The proxy records a connection once its outcome is known: an allowed connection when
  the dial succeeded or failed, a denied one at once. A request inside a terminated
  connection is recorded when its response's headers arrive.
- Behind a wall a run with a server always has its authority, made at the start and
  given to the enclosure, so a reload that brings path rules or credentials can
  terminate the hosts concerned. Without a wall the proxy cannot hold path rules: the
  hosts a reloaded policy holds to paths are taken out of its allow list, denied under
  `enforce` and recorded like any other, the event carries no `paths`, and a report
  line says why.
- `receiver.MaxBody` is 2 MiB, twice the size the contract cuts a batch at, since it
  is what the handler reads before it has verified anything; it was 16 MiB.
- The secret of a server document, and the key, never appear in an event or a log; the
  ping and the run's record hold the events URL and the run configuration URL only.

### Removed

- `webhook.schema.json`, `fixtures/webhook/`, `session.Webhook`, `Spec.Webhook`,
  `ResendSpec.Webhook`, `internal/webhook` and `internal/receiver`.
- The narrowing of the allow list by the harness's declared hosts, and
  `policy.Loaded.Narrow`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-19

### Upgrading

- A caller in Go resolves the runtime before the run: `session.Spec.Runtime` is a
  `runtimes.Runtime`, not a name, and `Spec.Descriptors` is gone. Where a spec had
  `Runtime: "claude"` and `Descriptors: dir`, call `catalog.Lookup("claude", dir)` from
  `github.com/qoryai/runner/runtimes/catalog` and give the spec what it returns. A name
  nothing describes was an error and is now a bare runtime, run and recorded with no
  session events.
- A receiver that requires `runtime_version` in `ai.qory.run.started` no longer finds it
  for a bare runtime; for a described one it is there as before.
- Nothing else changes for a run that uses none of what this release adds: a run whose
  policy selects no credential and has no path rule makes no authority and terminates no
  TLS, and the events it produces only gained optional fields.

### Added

- `session.Spec.Timeout`: a time limit for the runtime. At the limit it is stopped as
  the context ending stops it, `ai.qory.run.exited` carries `reason: timeout`, and
  `Result.TimedOut` is set.
- `runtimes.Runtime`: the boundary between the runner and the program it runs, as
  `wall.Wall` is for an enclosure. A runtime says how a launch is prepared, what its
  records mean and how it is asked to leave; the session package knows no program.
  `runtimes.Described` is a runtime written as a descriptor, `runtimes.Bare` a program
  the runner runs and does not read, `runtimes/claude` Claude Code, and
  `runtimes/catalog.Lookup` resolves a name: the machine's descriptor, the contract's,
  or bare, so any program runs behind a wall. `runtimes/runtimetest` is the conformance
  suite, `Conforms` and `Replays`.
- The descriptor's `stop` section, `signal` and `grace`: how a runtime is asked to
  leave. A run's own `StopSignal` and `StopGrace` override it.
- `session.Spec.StopSignal` and `Spec.StopGrace`: how the runner stops a runtime, at the
  limit or when its context ends. The signal is one of SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGHUP, SIGQUIT,
  SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2, SIGTERM unless named, since a runtime may close its session on one
  and drop it on another; the grace is the time until SIGKILL, ten seconds unless named.
  `session.CheckStopSignal` is the check.
- `session.Spec.Labels`: the caller's own names for the run, reported as `labels` in
  `ai.qory.run.started` and nowhere else. At most 16, keys of `a-z`, `0-9`, `_`, `.`
  and `-`, values of at most 256 bytes.
- `session.Spec.Limits` and `wall.Limits`: processors, memory, processes and the size
  of `/dev/shm` for the agent's container, as `--cpus`, `--memory`, `--pids-limit` and
  `--shm-size` with the Docker adapter. The relay gets none.
- `session.ReadPolicy` and `Policy.Under`: a command reads a run's own policy file and
  puts it under the machine's, which it can only narrow.

- Credentials the session never holds. `Spec.Credentials` are the machine's: a secret
  from a variable of the runner's environment, from a file, or from an adapter, a
  program of the machine's that knows one kind of host and prints, as
  `credential.schema.json`, the secret, its expiry, and the hosts, the scheme and the
  paths it is for. A policy's new `credentials` selects among them by name, with an
  argument for an adapter, and defines none. Behind a wall the proxy sets each on the
  requests to its hosts; the enclosure gets placeholders, never a secret. An adapter is
  asked again before its secret expires and when a host answers 401.
- Path rules: `egress.paths` in the policy, and the `paths` of a credential. Of a host
  with paths the run reaches those and no other, so a repository's credential does not
  open another organization's on the same host. A path that could be read two ways is
  denied in either mode.
- TLS termination, for the hosts a credential is for and the hosts with path rules, and
  no other: the proxy answers as the host with a certificate of an authority made for
  the run, whose key never leaves the runner's memory. `wall.Launch.CA` gives a wall the
  certificate; the Docker adapter shows the enclosure one bundle, the image's own
  authorities and the run's, and sets `SSL_CERT_FILE`, `GIT_SSL_CAINFO`,
  `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`, `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` and `CURL_CA_BUNDLE`, or `Docker.CAEnv`.
  `ai.qory.run.policy_applied` lists `credentials`, `paths` and the `terminated` hosts,
  and on a terminated host `ai.qory.run.egress` is one event per request with
  `request_method`, `path`, `path_rule` and `credential`.
- Work in the background, in the Claude Code descriptor: `ai.qory.session.turn_finished`
  and `ai.qory.session.subagent_finished` carry `background_tasks`, the runtime's own
  list of what is still running, each with its id, type, status, description, and a
  shell's command or a subagent's type. A background command's start was already a
  `tool_started` with `run_in_background` in its input. The runtime reports no exit
  status and no duration for such a task, so the record has neither.
- The conformance suite checks, from inside the enclosure, that a host held to paths is
  held to them, that a terminated host is answered with the run's authority and held to
  its credential's paths, that the credential is set outside, and that no secret and no
  key is inside: not in the environment, not in the bundle, not in the record.
- `session.Resend`: completes and delivers the record of a run that is over, for a
  job's last step after a runner that died or a receiver that was away. The run
  directory gains `delivered.log`, a line per accepted batch written as the answer
  comes, and `lock`, held while the runner lives; a run that still goes is
  `ErrRunning`. A record with no `ai.qory.run.exited` gets one with `reason:
  runner_lost`, and the events no accepted batch named are posted in order.
- `wall.Reaper`, and `Docker.Reap`: removes the containers and networks that carry a
  run's label, what a runner that died left behind. `Resend` asks for it.

### Requirements

- The Docker adapter is tested on Linux with Docker Engine 28, in CI, and with Docker
  Engine 29 on OrbStack; the conformance suite passes on both. It may work on an earlier
  engine, and that is not tested. It depends on the bridge option
  `com.docker.network.bridge.inhibit_ipv4`, which is in the engine's source at 24.0 and
  was not looked for before it, and on the `host-gateway` address. On an engine nobody
  has tried, run the suite: `go test ./wall/walltest` with `QORY_WALL_HELPER` naming its
  Linux build.

### Changed

- **Breaking for a caller in Go.** `session.Spec.Runtime` is a `runtimes.Runtime`, not a
  name, and `Spec.Descriptors` is gone: `catalog.Lookup(name, dir)` gives the runtime a
  name and a descriptor directory gave before. A nil `Runtime` is a bare one named after
  the command. A name nothing describes was an error and is now a bare runtime, and
  `runtime_version` in `ai.qory.run.started` is absent for one.
- The contract's limit that the proxy never reads a TLS connection now has its one
  exception, stated in every run's record: a terminated host. A run whose policy selects
  no credential and has no path rule is as before, with no authority made at all.
- Behind a wall the proxy serves the run's relay alone. Its address was reached by
  other containers of the same engine, on a Linux host, and by other processes of the
  machine; the run's policy bounded what they did with it. Now the relay opens every
  connection it forwards with a secret of the run's, `Launch.ProxyToken`, given to the
  relay through a file and to nothing inside the enclosure, and the proxy closes
  unanswered whatever opens otherwise. An adapter of your own passes the secret to its
  relay, which is `wall.Relay` with `QORY_RELAY_TOKEN` in its environment.
- A `Spec.RunID` that is not a UUID in the canonical lower-case form is refused. It
  went unchecked into the run directory's path and into the events' `subject`, which
  the envelope's schema holds to a UUID.
- The Docker adapter refuses a mount that is a socket, or a directory holding a
  container runtime's socket.

### Fixed

- The contract's event table listed `path` in `ai.qory.run.policy_applied`, which no
  schema and no runner has had since the policy became a value, and said every session
  event may carry `agent_id`, which `ai.qory.session.result` cannot.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-17

### Added

- The wall, `wall.Wall`: an optional enclosure for the runtime whose only route out
  leads to the session runner's proxy, so a program that ignores the proxy variables
  reaches nothing instead of going unseen. The session runner stays outside with the
  policy and the webhook's secret, and the enclosure sees the run directory read-only. `session.Spec` gains `Wall`, `Image` and `Mounts`;
  under a wall a nil `Env` is nothing, not the process's own, and
  `ai.qory.run.started` carries `wall` and `image`.
- The Docker adapter, `wall.Docker`, through the `docker` command and no library: an
  `--internal` network for the agent whose bridge holds no address of the host's, a relay container on that network and an ordinary
  one, both containers as the caller's user with every capability dropped and no new
  privileges, the workspace at its own path, the runner's settings read-only, the
  environment through a file so no value is on a command line, and everything removed at
  exit. The proxy binds the network's gateway on a Linux host and stays on loopback where
  the engine is in a virtual machine.
- The guard: behind a wall, or with `ProxyBind` set, the proxy refuses the link-local
  range always, and the runner's own machine, loopback and every address it holds,
  unless an allow entry names the host itself, in either mode. The way around the wall
  is not through the proxy, and a local MCP server or model endpoint is reached through
  it when the policy names it. A refused literal address or `localhost` is a denied
  `ai.qory.run.egress` with the rule `wall:own-address`; a name that resolves to one is
  refused when dialled.
- `wall.Relay`, the one peer an enclosure reaches: it copies a fixed port to one address
  fixed when it starts. The caller's binary runs it in a mode of its own and is mounted
  into the enclosure as the relay and the hook forwarder, so the wall needs no image.
- The conformance suite, `wall/walltest`: the contract's guarantees checked from inside
  the enclosure with a real session behind the adapter. CI runs it against Docker on a
  Linux machine, where a skip is a failure; golden files pin the adapter's command lines
  everywhere else.
- `session.Spec.ProxyBind`, the address the proxy listens on, for a caller that builds
  an enclosure of its own; loopback stays the default.
- `session.Spec.Events`, a stream that gets every event as the JSON line `events.jsonl`
  holds: a run with no receiver is followed on standard output.
- The contract gains §The wall: the guarantees, what crosses, the relay, the suite and
  what ships; and under §Limits the three outcomes of a connection, the model credential
  inside the enclosure, the proxy's address on a Linux host, and hooks on an engine in a
  virtual machine.
- `QORY_RUN_SOCKET` is read as an address: a path, or `unix:` and a path, is the local
  socket, and another scheme is a transport the forwarder refuses by name, so a network
  transport can be added without an old forwarder misreading it.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- The runner contract, `contracts/runner/v1/`: the policy document, the webhook
  configuration, the event types with a JSON schema per data type, the batch and
  signature rules, the runtime descriptor schema, and the Claude Code descriptor with its
  fixtures. The `contracts` package embeds the directory and its tests validate every
  fixture against the schemas.
- The session runner, `session.Run`: the policy, given by the caller as a value and
  validated against the schema, pinned with the digest of its canonical JSON, or observe
  with none; the webhook configuration given the same way; the loopback proxy in observe and enforce modes, one `run.egress` event per
  connection and a 403 for a denied one; the session on a pseudo-terminal when
  interactive and on pipes otherwise, its output chunked into `run.log`; the runtime's
  descriptor mapping its JSON lines and its hook calls to session events; the hook
  forwarder installed into the settings the launch passes, reporting over a local
  socket; a heartbeat; `run.exited` as the result; `events.jsonl` and `output.log`
  under `.qory/runs/<id>/`.
- The webhook sink: a ping the receiver must accept before the run starts when a
  webhook is configured, and none when it is not; signed batches with a delivery id;
  retries with backoff; 410 as stop; what is not accepted spooled under `undelivered/`
  and counted at exit.
- `internal/receiver`, the receiving side the tests run the webhook sink against: a
  handler that verifies the signature in constant time, deduplicates on event id and
  appends to a file that remembers its ids across restarts.
- The contract states that no declaration and an empty declaration differ: no list
  leaves the policy's allow list as it is, an empty list under enforce reaches nothing.
  It names the policy's `egress.allow` grammar as the one definition of a declared host,
  which the harness contract copies.
