// Package wall builds the enclosure an agent runs in: a place with no route out except
// to the session runner's proxy.
//
// The session runner stays outside. It owns the proxy, the policy decision and the
// record; a [Wall] owns only what makes a connection around the proxy fail rather than
// succeed unseen. An adapter wraps the launch and nothing else: the session runner asks
// the [Enclosure] where its proxy must listen, starts the wrapped command on the
// pseudo-terminal or the pipes it already owns, and closes the enclosure at exit.
//
// What every wall guarantees is one list, contracts/runner/v1/README.md §The wall, the
// same for every adapter, and the conformance suite in the walltest package checks it
// from inside the enclosure. An adapter ships when the suite passes for it. [Docker] is
// the first.
