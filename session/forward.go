// Forward is the hook forwarder: it reads one JSON object from r, the hook's input,
// and sends it to the socket named by QORY_RUN_SOCKET in the environment as one record
// of the hooks source. The command the runner installs as a hook calls it and exits 0
// with no output whatever happened, so the runtime never sees a decision; an error is
// for the command's own log. No socket in the environment is an error.
