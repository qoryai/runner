# Runner contract, v1

What the runner reads, and what it emits. The runner is the security boundary around one
coding agent session: the only thing between the agent and the world. This directory is
its contract: the documents, one JSON schema per document, and the fixtures a reader or
a receiver is tested against.

## Versions

Every document here contains `version: 1`, an integer, and its schema is addressed by
URL under `https://qory.dev/contracts/runner/v1/`. The harness contract of `qory`
spells its version differently, `apiVersion: qory.dev/v1alpha1`, and the difference is
the rule, not an accident. A document a person writes and commits, the stack and the
module manifest, contains the group and the version together, the way a Kubernetes
object does, because the file is read on its own and its format evolves with the
product. A document addressed by a schema URL, read or written by a program, contains an
integer that guards its reader, because the URL already contains the group and the
generation. The policy, the server document, the documents a server answers and the
descriptor are on this side: the objects the command passes to the runner and the ones a
control plane sends over the wire, and the compose report `qory` writes is versioned
the same way. CloudEvents adds its own `specversion: 1.0`, which is not ours to change.

**Revisions.** This is `v1`, revision 1. The runner sends the revision as one integer:
the header `X-Qory-Contract-Version: 1` on every request to the server, and
`contract_version: 1` in the ping's data. A runner on revision N reads every section
defined up to N and ignores any other section, and a server may rely on the sections up
to N and no more. An addition is a new revision; a breaking change is `v2`. An addition
made while no released runner is in use goes into the revision the runner sends; the
revision is raised only when a released runner is in use. Revision 1 is everything this
document describes: the server (§The server), tools (§Tools) and images (§Images), where
`container_runtime` and `docker` belong to an option that is experimental (§The wall).

`v1` is the first generation of this namespace, not a stability promise. The runner
module is at `v0`, which under Go's rules promises no compatibility: while the module is
at `v0`, a document or an event here may change in a way that breaks a reader, and the
changelog lists each such change. With the module at `v1`, a breaking change is a new
event type or a new directory, `v2`, never a change in place.

## The boundary

The runner's duties, in the order that matters when they conflict:

1. **Policy.** The runner reads one policy document, pinned for the run, that can only
   narrow what the binary allows: the egress mode, the allow list, the deny list, the
   paths of a host, and which of the machine's credentials the run may use. A policy
   that cannot be read means no run. No policy means observe everything, with no
   list to deny by. Nothing in a policy grants; a stale or failed policy degrades toward more
   restrictive, never toward more permissive.
2. **Egress.** The runner runs an HTTP proxy, on loopback or, behind a wall, on the one
   address the enclosure reaches (§The wall), and starts the session behind it.
   Every connection the session opens through the proxy is observed and recorded as one
   event: the host, the port, whether it was a `CONNECT` tunnel or a plain request, the
   decision, and the rule that made it. A connection to a host the deny list covers is
   denied in either mode; in enforce mode a connection to a host outside the allow
   list is denied as well. A denied attempt is recorded and the session continues; a
   denial never ends a run.
3. **Credentials.** The session sees none of the runner's. On a developer machine the
   session runs with the developer's own environment. Behind a wall the runner keeps the
   credentials the run's policy selects in memory, outside the enclosure, and its
   proxy sets each on the requests to the hosts it is for (§Credentials): the session
   reaches a code host and a model endpoint as itself and never reads what it is. The
   tools the policy selects run outside as well, and the proxy sends them the requests to
   the hosts they serve (§Tools).
4. **Liveness.** A heartbeat while the session runs; the exit as the result.
5. **Reporting.** The session's terminal bytes as log chunks, the runner's observations
   as events, the runtime's own output mapped to session events by a descriptor. Every
   event goes to files. When a server is configured, every event its configuration lists
   goes there too. When the caller passes a stream, standard output say, every event
   goes there as well, as the line `events.jsonl` contains; that is how a run with no
   receiver is followed.
6. **The harness reports over a local socket**, never over a network. A hook the
   runtime calls forwards what it received to the runner's socket; the runner is the
   only thing that sends to a receiver.

## Limits

Stated so a receiver reads the record for what it is.

- The proxy sees host names and ports, never the content of a TLS connection: a
  `CONNECT` tunnel is a blind relay once established. The exception is stated in the
  run's record: behind a wall, for a host the run has a credential or path rules for, or
  a tool serves, the proxy ends the session's TLS itself and reads each request's method
  and path. `dev.qory.run.policy_applied` lists those hosts as `terminated`, and no
  other host is read.
- On a terminated host the session's side of the connection is HTTP/1.1, so a protocol
  that needs HTTP/2 end to end, gRPC say, does not work there, and a program that pins
  the host's own certificate refuses the run's. A host that sends a request's headers
  back, an echo service, returns the credential the proxy set to the session. A path rule
  reads a path and nothing else: where a host takes every request on one path, a
  GraphQL endpoint say, the path is reachable or it is not, and what the request may
  touch behind it is bounded by the credential's own scope, not by the runner.
- Only proxy-aware programs are seen. The agent CLIs, git over HTTPS, curl, the package
  managers and the language runtimes read the proxy variables; SSH, and any program that
  ignores the variables, is not seen. Without a wall, enforce mode is
  advisory against such a program. Enforcement against bypass belongs to the wall (§The
  wall): the session runner runs outside and the agent in an enclosure whose only route
  out leads to the proxy. The three outcomes: a connection through the proxy is decided
  by the policy and recorded, on any machine; a connection around the proxy succeeds
  unseen without a wall, and fails unseen behind one. The runner records what passes
  through it and nothing else; a record of attempts a wall refuses is the container
  layer's own logging, or the network's.
- A wall decides which process may connect, not where the machine may connect. A packet
  filter in front of a node cannot distinguish the agent from the runner, so its list is
  the union of both; the run's policy can only be enforced at the proxy. Neither
  distinguishes two accounts on one allowed host: a code host, an object store and a
  model endpoint each deliver data to whoever owns the account the request specifies.
- A credential the run passes into the enclosure's environment is the agent's; one the
  policy selects stays outside (§Credentials). What is passed in is the agent's: a
  checkout that keeps a token in the repository's configuration passes the token in with
  the workspace. The run directory is shown read-only, so the agent cannot change
  `events.jsonl`; when it lies inside the workspace the agent can still rename the
  directory above it, which moves the record and does not alter it. The server's copy is
  out of reach either way.
- Behind a wall the exit status is the adapter's command's. With Docker that is the
  runtime's status, except that `125` is the engine failing to start the container,
  `126` and `127` the program not being startable in the image, and a runtime killed by
  a signal arrives as `128` plus the signal's number, with `signal` absent.
- The proxy behind a wall listens where the enclosure reaches it, which other
  containers of the same engine, or other processes of the machine, reach too. It
  serves none of them: the run has a token that only its relay receives, every connection
  the relay forwards opens with `QORY-RELAY`, a space, the token and a newline before
  the first byte of HTTP, and a connection that opens otherwise is closed unanswered
  and reported once. The token is never inside the enclosure.
- On an engine inside a virtual machine, a Mac's say, the hook socket does not cross the
  file share, so a walled run there has no session events from hooks; the log, the
  egress record and the structured output are unaffected. The forwarder's only
  transport is the local socket (§The local socket).
- The runtime's session events are what the runtime reports through its hooks and its
  structured output. A runtime that reports nothing produces no session events; the log
  and the egress record are the runner's own and are always there.
- A descriptor matches and copies. It never computes, so a mapping that needs a program
  is a runner change, never a configuration change.
- The server is trusted with what it is sent. The secret authenticates the runner to
  the server; only TLS authenticates the server to the runner.

## Sequence

One run, on a developer machine, with a server configured:

1. The runner receives a launch spec: the program, its arguments, its environment and
   directory, whether the session is interactive, the policy document, the server
   document, the egress the harness declared, and the runtime name. The spec comes
   from the `qory` command, which reads the policy and the server from its own
   configuration; the runner knows nothing of what composed it or where it was read.
2. The runner creates a run id, a UUID version 7, and the run directory
   `.qory/runs/<id>/` in the checkout.
3. It validates the server document once, when one is passed, and fetches the server's
   configuration document with a signed `GET` (§The server). It posts one
   `dev.qory.ping` to the events URL the document defines and waits for a 2xx. A fetch
   that fails, a document the schema refuses, or a ping not accepted means the run does
   not start: a run configured to be observed never runs unobserved by accident.
   The `--local` flag of the command runs with the file sink alone and contacts no
   server. With no server configured there is no fetch and no ping, and the run starts
   at once, files only.
4. It determines the policy. When the server's configuration contains a `run` section, it
   fetches the run configuration, with every label of the run as the query, and its
   `security_policy` is the policy; anything but `200` is no run.
   Otherwise the policy is the one the command passes. It validates the policy once.
   Refused by the schema: the run does not start. Absent: mode `observe`, everything
   allowed and recorded. Present: pinned, with the digest of its canonical JSON as its
   stamp. The allow list and the deny list are the policy's entries; the hosts the
   harness declared are reported and decide nothing (§The policy).
5. It starts the proxy on a loopback port and sets `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` and
   `NO_PROXY` in the session's environment, in upper and lower case, with
   `NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1,::1` so a local MCP server or model endpoint still
   answers. It opens the local socket and sets `QORY_RUN_SOCKET` to its path and
   `QORY_RUN_ID` to the run id. Nothing else of the runner's enters the environment.
6. It has the runtime prepare the launch (§The runtime): for a runtime that takes hooks,
   the runner's forwarder as a command hook for each event the runtime lists. For Claude
   Code that is a copy of the settings file the launch passes, written as
   `settings.json` in the run directory and passed in its place. What is prepared goes
   into the run directory; the composed home is not modified.
7. It emits `dev.qory.run.started` and `dev.qory.run.policy_applied`, then starts the
   program: on a pseudo-terminal when the caller is interactive and no argument the
   descriptor lists as headless is among the runtime's, on pipes otherwise.
8. While the program runs: every chunk of output is one `dev.qory.run.log`; on a
   pseudo-terminal every resize is one `dev.qory.run.resized`; every connection through
   the proxy is one `dev.qory.run.egress`; every record the descriptor matches is one
   session event; every thirty seconds one `dev.qory.run.heartbeat`.
9. The program exits. The runner drains the socket, so a hook on the runtime's last
   event is still read, emits `dev.qory.run.exited`, waits up to fifteen seconds for the
   sinks to flush, reports what the server has not accepted, and returns the program's exit
   status. A runtime killed by a signal exits as `-1` with `signal` set.

A run may have a time limit. When the runtime still runs at the limit the runner stops
it, and `dev.qory.run.exited` contains `reason: timeout` with the state `failed`; step 9
is otherwise the same. A denied connection never ends a run; the limit is the one thing
of the runner's that does.

The runner stops a runtime the same way at the limit and when its own context ends: a
signal that requests the runtime's exit, then SIGKILL after a grace. The signal is one of
SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGHUP, SIGQUIT, SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2, since runtimes differ in what
each means: one closes its session on SIGINT and drops it on SIGTERM, another the other
way round. So the runtime defines which and how long (§The runtime), the run may set
others over it, and with neither it is SIGTERM and ten seconds. Behind a wall the
enclosure passes the same signal on to the runtime inside.

The run id is the runner's own, a UUID version 7, unless the caller already has one: a
caller's id is a UUID in the canonical lower-case form, since it is every event's
`subject` and the run directory's name, and anything else is no run. What else the caller
knows the run by, a key in its queue, a repository, an issue, goes in `labels` on
`dev.qory.run.started`: at most 16, a key of 1 to 64 of `a-z`, `0-9`, `_`, `.` and `-`, a
value of at most 256 bytes. The runner reads nothing into them. It copies them into
`dev.qory.run.started`, and no other event repeats them: a receiver joins on `subject`.
It sends them, all of them, on the run configuration request (§The server), and the
server decides which labels identify what the run works on. The `qory` command, for one,
labels a run in a git checkout with `forge` and `repository` from its origin remote, and
a server that keys its policies on those finds them there.

Behind a wall, three steps differ and no event does. Before step 5 the runner starts the
tools the policy selects and waits until each listens (§Tools), then has the wall
prepare the enclosure and listens on the address the wall returns, not on loopback.
After step 6 it passes the wall the launch, the proxy's address, the socket and the
run directory, read-only, and starts the command the wall returns, on the same pseudo-terminal or
pipes; the proxy and socket variables inside contain the addresses the enclosure reaches
them on. After step 9 it closes the wall, which removes everything it created, and stops
the tools.
`dev.qory.run.started` contains `wall` and `image`, and `image_name`, `container_runtime`
and `docker` when the image is one the machine defines (§Images).

Under a node runner, step 1 is the node runner passing the same spec down through the
environment, with the run id it already has; everything after is one code path.

## The policy

`policy.schema.json`. The document the command passes to the runner, from the machine's
own configuration, never from inside the checkout, where the agent it constrains can
write it: for `qory`, the `egress` section of `~/.config/qory/runner.yaml`. The same
document a server's run configuration contains as `security_policy` (§The server), so
nothing is designed twice.

```yaml
version: 1
egress:
  mode: enforce                # or observe
  allow:
    - api.anthropic.com
    - github.com
    - "*.github.com"           # every host below github.com; not github.com itself
  deny:
    - gist.github.com          # denied in either mode, whatever allow contains
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `version` | `1`. A runner refuses a version it does not read, and the error contains that version |
| `egress.mode` | `observe`: every connection is recorded, and only a host `deny` covers is denied. `enforce`: a connection to a host outside `allow` is denied as well, and recorded |
| `egress.allow` | lower-case host names, or `*.` followed by a name for every host below it. No ports, no paths, no schemes. Absent is empty, and `enforce` with an empty list reaches nothing |
| `egress.deny` | hosts the session may not reach, in `allow`'s grammar, in either mode: a host an entry covers is denied before `allow` and the mode are consulted, whatever `allow` contains, and the entry is the rule reported. Absent is empty |
| `egress.paths` | by host, in `allow`'s grammar, the paths the session may request on it: a path matched whole, or up to a final `*` as a prefix. A host listed is terminated, which needs a wall; a host not listed is reached on every path. An empty list is no path at all |
| `credentials` | the credentials of the machine's the run may use: `name`, and an `argument` for an adapter, a repository say, of at most 4096 characters. A policy defines none (§Credentials) |
| `tools` | the tools of the machine's the run may reach: `name`, and an `argument` when the definition takes one, of at most 4096 characters. A policy defines none (§Tools) |
| `image` | the image of the machine's the run starts in, by the machine's name for it; absent is the machine's default. A policy contains no reference and defines no image (§Images) |

**The harness's declared hosts.** The harness compose reports the hosts its modules
declare, the command passes that list to the runner, and `dev.qory.run.policy_applied`
reports it as `harness_hosts`; it decides nothing. The policy alone decides: `allow` is
the policy's list, a declared host the policy does not cover is denied under `enforce`
like any other, and one `deny` covers is denied in either mode. The grammar of a declared
host is that of `egress.allow`, defined here once; the harness contract copies it and
cites this document.

**Matching a connection.** The host of a `CONNECT` request is its authority; the host of
a plain request is the authority of its absolute-form target, never its `Host` header.
Host names are compared lower-case; an IP literal matches only an identical entry.
`deny` is decided first: when an entry of it covers the host, the connection is denied
in either mode and that entry is the rule reported; only then `allow` and the mode
decide. `deny` beats `allow` whatever the shapes: `allow: ["*.example"]` with
`deny: ["tracker.example"]` denies `tracker.example` and reaches `api.example`, and a
host both lists cover is denied. A denied host is never reached, so its paths and a
credential for it never apply; the guard of a walled proxy (§The wall) decides before
either list. In each list the first entry that matches is the rule reported. A denial
is a `403 Forbidden` with a one-line text body containing the host and the mode; a tunnel
is never opened for it.

**Matching a path.** On a terminated host every request is decided, by the policy's
paths for the host and by the paths of the credential that is for it, and it passes
when every list that exists has an entry that matches. The comparison is exact, case
included: on a host that ignores case this denies a spelling the host accepts,
never the reverse, so whoever writes a path writes it as the host does. A path
that could be read two ways is denied in either mode, with the rule
`wall:ambiguous-path`: an encoded slash, backslash, dot or percent sign, a backslash, an
empty segment, a dot segment. Under `observe` a path no entry matches is recorded as
denied and let through, as a host is, but the credential is set only where its own paths
match: observe mode sends no token to a path nobody configured. The host
requested upstream is the one the connection was opened to and decided on, whatever
`Host` a request contains. A denial is a `403` containing the method, the host and the path.
A plain request is decided by the same paths, and the proxy never sets a credential on it.

*Reading without writing.* Paths define what a run does on a host as well as where. git
over HTTPS requests three paths of a repository, on any host that serves it:
`/<repo>.git/info/refs`, then `/<repo>.git/git-upload-pack` for a fetch or
`/<repo>.git/git-receive-pack` for a push. A run allowed the first two and not the third
clones and fetches, with the credential set, and its push is refused before it leaves
the machine: git reports `HTTP 403` and fails, the record contains the denied `POST`, and
nothing reaches the repository, whatever the token itself permits. Rules match the path
and never the query, so the `info/refs` a push requests first is allowed; it lists the
same refs a fetch reads.

*What a path rule does not read.* A rule reads the request's path and nothing else:
not its query, not its headers, not its body. What a request specifies there is outside
the rule: a subresource requested in the query, `?acl` say; a listing whose prefix is a
query parameter, on a host that lists at `/`; a copy that sets its source in a header,
which writes under an allowed path what it reads from another; a GraphQL body that
selects any repository the token reaches. A path rule limits a run to the paths it
lists and covers nothing else. The rest is bounded by the credential's own scope, or by
what serves the host, and whoever writes the policy for a host that accepts such
requests checks them there or leaves the host out.

## Credentials

A credential is a token the runner keeps for the session and the session never sees.
The machine defines credentials; the run's policy selects among them by name and
defines none, so whoever writes a policy chooses among the programs the machine's owner
installed and never specifies one. They need a wall: without one a program that ignores the
proxy is bound by nothing here.

A definition defines where the token comes from, exactly one of:

| Source | The token is |
|---|---|
| `env` | a variable of the runner's own environment, read once when the run starts |
| `file` | a file's content, read again whenever it is used, so whatever rotates it notifies no one |
| `adapter` | what a program of the machine's prints |

**An adapter** handles one kind of host: a source code host, an artifact store. The
runner handles none, so nothing in it refers to one. The runner starts the adapter
outside the enclosure, with its own environment, a minute to answer, and `${argument}`
in its arguments replaced by the policy's argument, which the definition's pattern must
match whole: one word of the command line, never a shell's. It prints one document,
`credential.schema.json`, and exits 0; anything else is no run, and the line it writes
to standard error is the reason reported.

```json
{"version": 1, "token": "…", "expires_at": "2026-09-19T14:00:00Z",
 "apply": [
   {"hosts": ["git.example.com"], "scheme": "basic", "username": "x-access-token",
    "paths": ["/acme/shop.git/*", "/acme/shop/*"]},
   {"hosts": ["api.git.example.com"], "scheme": "bearer",
    "paths": ["/repos/acme/shop", "/repos/acme/shop/*"]}],
 "placeholders": ["GIT_HOST_TOKEN"]}
```

The adapter's answer defines how its token is used, because hosts differ in it: which
hosts, which scheme, and which paths make up what the run requests. The schemes are a
closed set, `bearer`, `basic` with a `username`, `header` with a header's name; an
adapter chooses among what the runner implements and adds nothing to it. Of a host with
`paths` the run reaches those and no other, so one repository's credential does not open
another organization's on the same host; a path the adapter leaves out, the host's
GraphQL endpoint say, is not reached. A definition may set `hosts` and `paths` of its
own for an adapter: the most the adapter may claim. For `env` and `file`, which have no
adapter to define the use, the definition's `hosts`, scheme and `paths` are the use
itself.

Before the run starts every selected credential is resolved, and any of these is
no run: a name the machine does not define, an argument it does not provide for, a host
two credentials claim, a claim above the definition's, and under `enforce` a host the
run's allow list does not cover. The runner runs an adapter again five minutes before
`expires_at`, and when a host returns 401 to a request it set the token on, at most
once every thirty seconds. The new answer changes the token and nothing else: one
that lists other hosts, schemes or paths is refused and reported, and the old token
stays, because what a run reaches is fixed when it starts.

**Placeholders.** A program often needs a credential set to start. A
definition, or an adapter's answer, lists variables the enclosure gets with the value
`qory-sets-the-credential-outside-the-enclosure`, which is no credential anywhere; the
proxy replaces what the program sends. A run that passes a value of its own for such a
variable does not start.

**Termination.** For the hosts the credentials are for, and the hosts with path rules,
the proxy ends the session's TLS itself, answering as the host with a certificate of an
authority created for the run. The authority's key is in the runner's memory and nowhere
else, and gone with the run; its certificate is what the wall adds to the enclosure's
trusted bundle (§The wall). The proxy verifies the real host against the machine's own
roots. Every other host stays a tunnel the proxy does not read, and a run with no
credential and no path rule has no authority at all.

**The record.** `dev.qory.run.policy_applied` contains each use, `name`, `hosts`, `scheme`
and `paths`, and the `terminated` hosts. On a terminated host `dev.qory.run.egress` is one
event per request, `method: HTTPS` with `request_method`, `path` without its query,
`path_rule`, and `credential`, the name of the one the proxy set. No event, no report
and no error contains a token.

## Tools

A tool is a program of the machine's that serves hosts, for what a run reaches that
needs more than a token in a header: a request signed with a key the session never sees,
a protocol with an exchange of its own, a service that exists only on the machine, an
MCP server say. The runner implements no protocol and a tool implements one, so no
protocol, cloud or provider enters the runner. The machine defines tools; the run's
policy selects among them by name, with an argument, as it selects credentials, and
defines none. Tools need a wall, as credentials do.

| Definition | Meaning |
|---|---|
| name | what a policy selects it by, in a credential's grammar |
| command | the program and its arguments; `${argument}` in an argument is replaced by the policy's argument |
| argument | a regular expression the policy's argument must match whole; none means a policy passes none |
| serves | the hosts whose requests go to the tool, in `egress.allow`'s grammar; at least one |
| placeholders | variables the enclosure gets with the placeholder value, as a credential's (§Credentials) |

```yaml
# the run's policy
egress:
  mode: enforce
  allow: [files.tools.internal]
  paths:
    files.tools.internal: [/media/acme/shop/*]
tools:
  - {name: files, argument: acme/shop}
```

**Starting.** Before the runtime starts, the runner starts every selected tool outside
the enclosure: the command, with `${argument}` replaced by the argument, one word of the
command line and never a shell's; the runner's own environment, without the variables
the machine's credentials are read from, with `QORY_TOOL_LISTEN`, the path of a Unix
socket in a private directory of the runner's, mode `0700`, and `QORY_RUN_ID`. The tool
listens there within a minute; one that exits first, or does not listen in time, is no
run, and the last line it writes to standard error is the reason reported. Once it
listens, what it writes to standard error is reported as the runner's own lines and its
standard output is discarded. A tool that exits while the run goes on is reported and
not started again: a request to it is a failed dial. When the run ends, once the proxy
is closed, the runner sends SIGTERM to the tool's process group, SIGKILL after five
seconds, and removes the socket.

**Reaching one.** For the hosts a tool serves, the proxy ends the session's TLS as for a
credential's host, decides the host and the path by the policy as for any host, and
sends every request it allows to the tool over the socket, as HTTP/1.1, streamed
both ways: the request as the session sent it, its query, headers, body and trailers,
placeholders included, with the `Host` the connection was decided on. A plain request to
such a host goes the same way. The proxy never dials a host a tool serves, so the host
need not exist: a tool with no host of its own serves a name the machine's owner
chooses, under `.internal` say, a name reserved for private use, and the session
reaches it like any host. The proxy sets two headers of its own, after removing every
header and trailer whose name starts `Qory-` from the request, in any case and with an
underscore for the dash, so the values a tool reads are the proxy's, and a session that
lists them in `Connection` cannot remove them:

| Header | Value |
|---|---|
| `Qory-Request-Id` | the proxy's id of the request, 32 lower-case hex digits: the `request_id` of its `dev.qory.run.egress` |
| `Qory-Path-Rule` | the path rule that allowed the request; `none` when the host has path rules and, under `observe`, none covers the path, which a tool that enforces its rules refuses; absent when the host has no path rules |

The argument is not repeated per request: a tool started for the run has it on its
command line.

**What the tool decides.** A path rule reads the path and nothing else (§The policy), so
what a request specifies in its query, its headers or its body is the tool's to check,
against its argument and the path rule it receives. A tool refines inside what the
runner allows and never widens it: a request the rules refuse never reaches it. What a
tool forwards, and where, leaves from the machine directly, not through the proxy; the
record contains only the request that reached the tool. A tool that forwards a request
unchanged sends the placeholder with it; replacing or dropping it is the tool's.

**Refused before the run starts:** a name the machine does not define, a tool selected
twice, an argument the definition does not provide for, a host two tools serve, a host a
tool serves and a credential is for, under `enforce` a host the run's allow list does not
cover, and a value the run passes for a tool's placeholder. The tools a run has are fixed
when it starts: a run configuration that selects other tools, or another argument, fails
the reload, and the policy in force stays.

**The record.** `dev.qory.run.policy_applied` lists the tools, `name` and `hosts`, and
their hosts among `terminated`. Every request to a tool's host is one
`dev.qory.run.egress`, a tool invocation: `method: HTTPS`, or `HTTP` for a plain
request, with `request_method`, `path` without its query, `path_rule`, `tool`, the
tool's name, `request_id`, and, once the tool answers, `status`. A request a path rule
refuses contains the tool it did not reach, with `decision: denied`; a connection the
policy refuses by its host, by the deny list, the guard or the allow list, contains
none. The runner reads no body, so what an invocation does beyond its method and its
path is the tool's to know; the runtime's hooks report the MCP call an agent makes
(`dev.qory.session.tool_started`).

## The events

Every event is a [CloudEvents 1.0](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/spec.md)
event in the [JSON format](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/formats/json-format.md).
`event.schema.json` is the envelope: the published CloudEvents schema, vendored as
`cloudevents.schema.json`, plus what this contract fixes. Every type starts `dev.qory.`,
the reverse-DNS name of qory.dev, the domain that roots every identifier of the
contract, as it roots the schema URLs.

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| `specversion` | `1.0` |
| `id` | a UUID, unique per event. A receiver deduplicates on it |
| `source` | `urn:qory:run:<run id>`. One run is one source, so `sequence` orders within it |
| `subject` | the run id. A receiver creates the run on the first event with an unknown subject |
| `type` | one of the types below, and nothing else. A breaking change to a type's data is a new type |
| `time` | the runner's clock, RFC 3339, UTC |
| `sequence` | the [sequence extension](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/extensions/sequence.md): the runner-assigned order of the event within the run, a decimal zero-padded to ten digits, from `0000000001`, contiguous. A receiver orders by it, never by arrival |
| `dataschema` | `https://qory.dev/contracts/runner/v1/events/<type without dev.qory.>.schema.json`, the schema of `data` |
| `datacontenttype` | absent, which the JSON format reads as `application/json` |
| `data` | a JSON object validating against `dataschema` |

The types, one namespace. The runner's own:

| Type | When | Data |
|---|---|---|
| `dev.qory.ping` | before the runtime starts, to the server's events endpoint only, when a server is configured | `runner_version`, `events`, `contract_version` |
| `dev.qory.run.started` | the runtime is about to start; the first event in the file | `runtime`, `runtime_version`, `command`, `args`, `dir`, `interactive`, `runner_version`, `host`, on a pseudo-terminal `terminal`, behind a wall `wall`, `image`, and when the machine's definition sets them `image_name`, `container_runtime` and `docker`, and `labels` when the caller passes any |
| `dev.qory.run.policy_applied` | right after, once; again at the sequence where a new run configuration takes effect | `mode`, `allow`, `deny`, `source`, and with them set `url`, `digest`, `run_configuration`, `harness_hosts`, `paths`, `credentials`, `tools`, `image`, `terminated` |
| `dev.qory.run.log` | one per chunk of output: on pipes one line or 4096 bytes, on a pseudo-terminal 4096 bytes or a quiet gap of 50 ms, whichever comes first | `stream`, `bytes` |
| `dev.qory.run.resized` | the pseudo-terminal was resized, at the sequence where the new size takes effect; never on pipes | `cols`, `rows` |
| `dev.qory.run.egress` | one per connection through the proxy, allowed or denied; on a terminated host one per request, and on a host a tool serves one per tool invocation | `host`, `port`, `method`, `decision`, `outcome`, `mode`, `rule`, and per request `request_id`, `status`, `request_method`, `path`, `path_rule`, `credential`, `tool` |
| `dev.qory.run.heartbeat` | every `interval_seconds` while the runtime runs | `elapsed_seconds`, `interval_seconds` |
| `dev.qory.run.exited` | the runtime exited; the result and the last event | `state`, `exit_code`, `signal`, `reason`, `duration_ms` |

The session's, produced by a descriptor from what the runtime reports:

| Type | When | Data |
|---|---|---|
| `dev.qory.session.started` | the runtime opened its session | `session_id`, `source`, `model`, `cwd` |
| `dev.qory.session.prompt_submitted` | a prompt reached the runtime | `session_id`, `prompt` |
| `dev.qory.session.tool_started` | the runtime is about to run a tool | `session_id`, `tool`, `tool_use_id`, `input` |
| `dev.qory.session.tool_finished` | a tool ran and returned | the same, `response`, `duration_ms` |
| `dev.qory.session.tool_failed` | a tool ran and failed | the same, `error`, `interrupted`, `duration_ms` |
| `dev.qory.session.turn_finished` | the runtime finished responding | `session_id`, `message`, `background_tasks` |
| `dev.qory.session.turn_failed` | a turn ended on an API error | `session_id`, `error`, `details`, `message` |
| `dev.qory.session.subagent_started` | a subagent was spawned | `session_id`, `agent_id`, `agent_type` |
| `dev.qory.session.subagent_finished` | a subagent finished | the same, `message`, `background_tasks` |
| `dev.qory.session.notification` | the runtime notified its user: waiting for a permission, idle | `session_id`, `kind`, `message`, `title` |
| `dev.qory.session.ended` | the runtime closed its session | `session_id`, `reason` |
| `dev.qory.session.result` | a non-interactive session printed its result | `session_id`, `outcome`, `is_error`, `turns`, `duration_ms`, `cost_usd`, `result` |

**Work in the background.** A runtime that starts a command or a subagent in the
background reports it where it reports everything else: the start is a tool call,
recorded as `dev.qory.session.tool_started` with the runtime's own `input`,
`run_in_background` in Claude Code's, and as `dev.qory.session.tool_finished` with
whatever the tool returned; a subagent's start and end are the subagent events, with its
`agent_id` and `agent_type`. After that the runtime reports a list, not an event: what
is still running, each entry with the runtime's `id`, `type`, `status` and
`description`, and a shell's `command` or a subagent's `agent_type`. The descriptor
copies it as `background_tasks` onto `turn_finished` and `subagent_finished`, so a
receiver that wants a task's end takes the first list the task is missing from. Claude
Code's list contains no exit status and no duration for a background task, so the record
has neither; a descriptor copies what a runtime reports and computes nothing, and the
runtime's own output stream contains the rest. What becomes of work in the background
when a run ends is the runtime's as well: it may end such work itself after its last
answer, wait for it up to a ceiling of its own, and read that ceiling from a variable.
The runner adds no rule of its own here. Behind a wall only the variables a run lists go
in, so such a variable is listed like any other; and the run's stop signal and grace are
what the runtime has to close such work when the runner stops it.

Every session event that comes from a hook may contain `agent_id` and `agent_type` when
it happened inside a subagent; `dev.qory.session.result`, read from the runtime's
output, contains neither. The schema of each type, under `events/`, defines which fields
are required and what each contains. Values are copied from the runtime unchanged:
`input` and `response` have the tool's own shape, `error` is display text, and the
enumerations in `source`, `reason`, `kind`, `outcome` are the runtime's words.

`dev.qory.run.policy_applied` records where the policy comes from: `source` is `none`,
`config` or `fetched`; `url` is where a fetched one was fetched from; `digest` is the
runner's own hex sha256 of the policy document's canonical JSON, with `config` and
`fetched`; `run_configuration` is the server's digest of the run configuration document
as its header contained it, with `fetched`; `allow` and `deny` are the policy's two lists
as written, `deny` the hosts denied by name in either mode. `dev.qory.run.egress` records
what becomes of the connection in `outcome`: `connected`, the dial succeeded;
`dial_failed`, allowed and the dial failed; `refused`, not dialled, because the policy
or the wall's guard denied it, or closed by a reload. An event that is one request, a
plain one or one inside a terminated connection, contains the proxy's `request_id` for
it, and `status`, the status the host or the tool returned, when one did.

The log is an event like the others. `bytes` is base64 of the chunk as the runtime
wrote it, terminal escapes included. On pipes the runtime's standard output and standard
error are chunked apart, `stream` is `stdout` or `stderr`, and a chunk is cut at a line
break or at 4096 bytes, whichever comes first, at a byte and not at a character: a
multibyte character may straddle two chunks, and the concatenation, not a chunk, is
text. On a pseudo-terminal `stream` is `terminal` and a line break cuts nothing: a
full-screen program redraws on every keypress, and cut at line breaks its record is
thousands of chunks of a few bytes. A terminal chunk is cut at 4096 bytes or once the
runtime has written nothing for 50 ms after its last write, whichever comes first, so
one redraw is one chunk, and never inside a multibyte character, so a chunk of UTF-8
output is text on its own. A stream that never pauses is cut at 4096 bytes; what is buffered
when the runtime exits is the last chunk.

A replay lays the redraws of a full-screen program over each other, which takes the
terminal's size, so the size is in the record. On a pseudo-terminal
`dev.qory.run.started` contains `terminal`, the columns and rows the runtime starts on:
the runner's own terminal's when it has one, 80 by 24 otherwise. Every change after that is
one `dev.qory.run.resized` with the new size, at the sequence where it takes effect: what
the gap has buffered is cut before it, so the chunks before it were written to a terminal
of the old size and the chunks after it to one of the new. On pipes there is no
`terminal` and no resize.

## The record files

`.qory/runs/<id>/` in the checkout, kept out of git by the compose:

- `events.jsonl`: every event of the run, one per line, in sequence order, the ping
  included when one is sent. The record of truth; the server's is a copy.
- `output.log`: the raw bytes of the session's output, the concatenation of the
  `dev.qory.run.log` chunks. Both files tail.
- `settings.json`: the runtime's settings with the runner's hooks added, when hooks
  are installed.
- `undelivered/`: the batches the server has not accepted, when there are any.

`fixtures/run/<id>/` are such directories, recorded. The control plane's CI replays them.

## The server

`server.schema.json`. The document the command passes to the runner, from the machine's
own configuration: for `qory`, the `server` section of `~/.config/qory/runner.yaml`,
with the secret from `QORY_SERVER_SECRET` when the file does not contain it. The runner is
a client of the server defined here and of nothing else: it fetches the server's
configuration, posts its events to the URL it defines, and takes the run's policy from the
server when the server offers one. A server is a control plane, or a plain receiver
that implements this section: discovery and the events endpoint are enough.
Configuring one makes the run fail closed on the discovery fetch and on the ping.

```yaml
version: 1
url: https://qory.example            # https, or http to a loopback address; scheme and host[:port] only
access_key: ak_f1xt0re000000000       # ak_ and 16 lower-case Crockford base32 characters
secret: fixture-secret-not-a-real-one # at least 16 characters; signs, never travels
```

`url` is the server's origin and nothing after it: no path, no query, no fragment. The
runner finds every endpoint through the configuration document under it. The access key
identifies the runner to the server and is sent in clear on every request; the secret
signs and is never sent. The pair follows the model of an AWS access key id and its secret
key. The secret lives outside any repository, in the machine's configuration or its
environment; it is never in a checkout and never in an event, and the only one in a
fixture is the published test secret, `fixture-secret-not-a-real-one`, under the
published key `ak_f1xt0re000000000`.

**On every request** to the server:

| Header | Value |
|---|---|
| `User-Agent` | `qory-runner/<version>` |
| `X-Qory-Access-Key` | the access key |
| `X-Qory-Contract-Version` | the revision of this contract the runner implements, `1` |

**A signed POST**, after [GitHub's model](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#delivery-headers).
One `POST` per batch to the events URL, with the headers above and:

| Header | Value |
|---|---|
| `Content-Type` | `application/cloudevents-batch+json` |
| `X-Qory-Delivery` | a UUID per batch. A retry of the same batch sends the same id |
| `X-Qory-Signature-256` | `sha256=` and the lower-case hex HMAC SHA-256 of the raw request body, keyed with the secret |
| `X-Qory-Run-Configuration` | the server's digest of the run configuration the run uses, `sha256=<hex>`, when it uses a fetched one; absent otherwise |

No timestamp is signed on a POST and no replay window is checked: a replayed batch is
a duplicate the receiver already discards by event id.

**A signed GET**, for the configuration document and the run configuration:

| Header | Value |
|---|---|
| `X-Qory-Timestamp` | Unix seconds, UTC, a decimal integer |
| `X-Qory-Signature-256` | `sha256=` and the lower-case hex HMAC SHA-256 of the canonical string, keyed with the secret |

The canonical string is three lines joined by `\n`, with no newline after the last: the
method in upper case; the request target exactly as sent, the path and then `?` and
the query only when the query is non-empty, nothing decoded, re-ordered or normalised
on either side; the timestamp as sent. The server accepts the request when
`|server now - timestamp| <= 300` seconds, in either direction. The canonical string
follows AWS Signature Version 4, reduced to what a request here has. Two known
answers:

- secret `test-secret`, canonical string `GET\n/.well-known/qory-configuration?x=1\n1700000000`:
  `sha256=e8cc6260e2740e9282f2b45fa8bc590e3afe0e59eb53882b19cdb0f87a613c02`
- the published secret, canonical string `GET\n/.well-known/qory-configuration\n1700000000`:
  `sha256=0c895b2f1c1c62629e6298a59746b975ccae2e5156b01f733d2d7768f6eb55a2`

**Failure.** Every authentication failure is `401` with the body
`{"error":"unauthorized"}` and nothing more: a header missing or empty, a key of the
wrong shape, a key the server does not know or has revoked, a timestamp that is not an
integer, a stale timestamp, a signature that does not match. The body never indicates which.
A header sent twice is refused. The server verifies with a constant-time comparison,
looks the key up only after its shape is checked, and logs nothing about the headers.
A redirect is not followed: a 3xx is a status like any other.

**The configuration document.** `configuration.schema.json`. A signed
`GET <url>/.well-known/qory-configuration`, the path after OpenID Connect discovery. The
answer is `200`, `application/json`, with the header `X-Qory-Configuration:
sha256=<hex>`, the server's digest of the document: opaque to the runner, which
compares it byte for byte and never recomputes it.

```json
{"version": 1,
 "events": {"url": "https://qory.example/v1/events", "types": ["*"]},
 "run": {"url": "https://qory.example/v1/run-configuration"}}
```

`version` and `events` are required. `events.url` is `https`, or `http` to a loopback
address; `events.types` is a non-empty list of full type names, or `*` for every type,
and the ping is always sent. `run` is optional: a server whose document has no `run` section
offers no run configuration, and the policy is the machine's. A top-level member the
runner does not know is ignored, which is how a new revision adds a section.

**The run configuration document.** `run-configuration.schema.json`. A signed `GET
<run.url>?<the run's labels>`: one query parameter per label, the label's key as the
name and its value as the value, a label with an empty value as `key=`, and no query
when the run has no label. The parameters are sorted by key and percent-encoded as a
form is, a space as `+`, so a run labelled `forge: github.com`, `issue: "77"` and
`repository: acme/shop` fetches
`<run.url>?forge=github.com&issue=77&repository=acme%2Fshop`. When `run.url` has a query
of its own, the labels are added to it, and a label replaces a parameter of the same
name. The server decides which labels identify what the run works on and returns the
policy for that; the runner reads nothing into them. The labels are bounded, at most 16,
a key of at most 64 bytes that needs no encoding and a value of at most 256 bytes, which
is at most 768 once encoded, so the query the labels make is at most 13,343 bytes; a
server whose front end limits a request line to less refuses the longest of them. The
reference receiver, once the request verifies, answers `400` to a query that is not
labels by these rules: a key sent twice, a key outside the grammar, a value too long or
not UTF-8, more than 16. The answer is `200`, `application/json`, with the headers
`X-Qory-Run-Configuration: sha256=<hex>` and `ETag: "sha256=<hex>"`, the same string,
quoted the second time.

```json
{"version": 1,
 "security_policy": {"version": 1, "egress": {"mode": "enforce", "allow": ["api.example"]}}}
```

`version` and `security_policy` are required; `security_policy` is a
`policy.schema.json` document, and it is the policy: the runner does not merge it with
the machine's or with the run's own. A member the runner does not know is ignored. The
digest is the server's and opaque; the runner keeps it, sends it back on every POST,
and never recomputes it. Anything but `200`, or a document the schema refuses, is no
run.

**Delivery.** The body of a POST is a `batch.schema.json` document: a JSON array of
events of one run, in sequence order, never empty. The runner cuts a batch at one
hundred events, at one mebibyte, or after one second since its first event, whichever
comes first; the ping is a batch of one, sent before anything else. A receiver verifies
the signature over the raw bytes with a constant-time comparison before parsing, then
deduplicates on each event's `id`, since delivery is at least once.

The server answers with a status; the body is ignored:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 2xx | accepted; the runner forgets the batch |
| 410 | stop: the server requests nothing more for this run. The runner sends no further batch and the run continues on the file sink |
| anything else, or no answer within ten seconds | retried with exponential backoff, one second doubling to one minute, until the run ends |

Every answer may contain `X-Qory-Configuration` and `X-Qory-Run-Configuration`, the
digests in force: of the configuration document, and of the run configuration for the
run's labels. The runner compares each to the one it keeps. A different
run-configuration digest means fetch the run configuration again and apply it; a
different configuration digest means fetch the configuration document again and use
its sections for the batches that follow: the events URL and the filter. A
header absent means nothing. This is how a control plane changes a run's policy while
it runs, and the whole of it: nothing in an answer's body is read.

**Reload**, when a fetched run configuration replaces the one in force, three rules:

1. The new policy takes effect for new connections at once, and the record gets a
   second `dev.qory.run.policy_applied`, with the new digests, at the sequence where it
   takes effect.
2. A tunnel open to a host the new policy denies is closed by the proxy and recorded as
   a denied `dev.qory.run.egress` with `outcome: refused` and the rule that denied it.
3. A host the new policy terminates TLS for is terminated on its next connection.

What is still undelivered when the run ends is spooled to `.qory/runs/<id>/undelivered/`
as batch files with their delivery ids, and the runner reports the count on its standard
error. The file sink has every event regardless. The server never delays the session:
posting is asynchronous behind a bounded queue, and a queue that fills spools to the
same directory rather than blocking the runtime.

**After a runner that died.** The run directory records what the server is still owed,
without the runner that wrote it. `events.jsonl` is written as events happen.
`delivered.log` beside it gets a line as each batch is accepted, the delivery id and the
sequence of every event in it, and the one word `stopped` for a 410. `lock` is held by
the runner for as long as it lives, by the kernel, so it is free once the runner is gone
however it went. Sending a run again is the job's last step, whatever happens before it:
refused while the lock is held; then what the run's wall leaves behind is removed, by
the run's label; a record with no `dev.qory.run.exited` gets one, numbered on from the
last event, with `state: failed`, `exit_code: -1` and `reason: runner_lost`; and every
event the server's filter selects that no accepted batch contained is posted, in order,
in batches cut the same way, until accepted or given up on. The resend fetches the
configuration document first, as a run does, and posts to the URL it defines. What is
still not accepted is under `undelivered/` again. A receiver sees some events twice when
the runner dies between an answer and its line, and discards them by `id` as any
duplicate. Nothing of this recovers a machine that dies: the record is lost with it, and
a receiver detects that from heartbeats that stop.

**The modes of a run:**

| The runner receives | Events go to | The policy comes from |
|---|---|---|
| nothing | files only | the machine's policy the command passes (`egress`), else observe everything |
| a server | the server's `events.url`, after a signed discovery fetch and a ping | the server's run configuration when it offers one, else the machine's policy |
| a server and `--local` | files only; the server is not contacted | the machine's policy |

A discovery fetch that fails, in transport, with a status other than `200` or with a
document the schema refuses, or a ping not accepted: no run, and the error contains the
URL and the status. A `run` section present and not answering `200`: no run. The
command's `--policy`, a run's own policy under the machine's, keeps its meaning without
a server; with a fetched run configuration the fetched policy is the policy, and
`--policy` is refused with an error that states so.

**The reference receiver** is the public package `receiver` of this module: a handler
that serves discovery, verifies each request as this section defines, returns the digest
headers, deduplicates and appends to a file. The module's own tests run the runner's
client against it. `fixtures/signed/` is what any receiver is tested against: one
request per file, `method`, `target`, `headers`, `body` (a string, or `null` for a
GET), the status a receiver answers as `expect`, and a `note` that explains why. Every
signature in them is real, under the published key and secret, and the timestamps are
around `1700000000`, where a receiver under test sets its clock. A receiver written by
anyone else follows this section, replays those files, and may read that code.

## The runtime

The runner starts a program, records it and stops it, and contains nothing specific to
one. What is
particular to one is behind an interface, `runtimes.Runtime` in the Go module, as an
enclosure is behind `wall.Wall`, and Claude Code is one implementation of it. A runtime
defines six things: its name and the version of the
program it was written against, reported in `dev.qory.run.started`; how a launch is
prepared so the program reports to the runner, which may change the arguments, add
variables and write into the run directory and nothing else; whether the program's
standard output is records to read; what event, if any, one record is; how the
program is stopped, a signal and a grace; and whether the arguments it is
started with mean it runs without an interface, so the session is on pipes whatever
the caller has.

There are three ways to a runtime, and a name resolves to the first that applies:

1. **A descriptor**, a runtime written as data (below): `<name>.yaml` in a directory
   the command sets, `~/.config/qory/runtimes/` for `qory`, then the one this contract
   ships under `runtimes/<name>/`. Nothing of a descriptor runs, so a machine adds a
   runtime or corrects one without a new binary.
2. **A bare runtime**, for a name nothing describes. Nothing is prepared and no record
   is read: the run's own events, its log and its egress record are all there, the
   session's are not. Any program runs behind a wall this way, with no descriptor.
3. **An implementation in Go**, for a caller that embeds the runner and whose program
   needs what a descriptor cannot express. It is set in `session.Spec.Runtime` like any
   other.

`runtimes/runtimetest` is what any of them is tested against: `Conforms`, that a runtime
leaves alone what is not its own, and `Replays`, that its records produce exactly the
recorded events and that each passes this contract's schema.

### The descriptor

`descriptor.schema.json`. One YAML file per runtime. It has five parts.

**Sources**: how the runner attaches. The terminal bytes always, with nothing to match
in them and so no source. `output`: JSON lines on the runtime's standard output, when
the session runs on pipes; a line that is not a JSON object is not a record. `hooks`:
the runtime's hook events, for each of which the runner installs its forwarder as a
command hook, the way `install` selects among the installers the binary has: a
descriptor selects an installer and never contains one, so a program that takes hooks
another way needs an installer in the runner before a descriptor can select it.
`claude-settings` adds a group per event under `hooks` in the JSON settings the launch
passes with `--settings`, leaving the groups already there. The forwarder writes the
JSON it reads on its standard input to the local socket, as one record. A forwarder
exits 0 and prints nothing, which every hook interface reads as no decision, so an
installed hook observes and never changes what the runtime does.

**Rules**: for each source, a match and a target. `match` is a map of dotted paths into
the record to values: equality with a string, number or boolean, or `{present: true}`.
Every entry must match. `data` is a map of the event's fields to dotted paths whose
values are copied unchanged; a path that does not exist leaves the field out, which is
how optional fields work. Rules run in order and the first that matches produces one
event; a record no rule matches produces nothing. No patterns, no expressions, no
defaults, no concatenation. A mapping that needs more than equality and presence is a
runner change.

**Stop**, optional: `signal`, one of the six above, and `grace`, a duration. It is how a
runtime that closes its session on one signal and drops it on another defines which.

**Headless**, optional: `args`, the arguments that mean the runtime runs without an
interface. When one of them is among the arguments the runtime is started with, the
session runs on pipes even at a terminal, exactly as when the caller requests pipes: the
runtime is recorded as not interactive, and the descriptor's `output` source is read. A
short argument matches the whole token (`-p`); a long one matches the token or its
`--name=value` form (`--print`, `--print=…`). Nothing else is inferred: a runtime that
takes its prompt on standard input, say, has no argument to list, and its caller sets
headless itself. Absent, the caller alone decides. Runtimes differ in which argument
means "no interface", which is why the descriptor defines the inference and not the
command.

**Fixtures**: `fixtures/<case>/records.jsonl`, records as the runtime produced them, in
the shape of `record.schema.json`, beside `expected/events.jsonl`, one `{type, data}`
per event the rules produce from them, in order. A descriptor without fixtures is not
accepted. The tests validate every record and every expected event against the schemas;
`runtimetest.Replays` replays the records through the runtime and compares.

`runtimes/claude/descriptor.yaml` is the Claude Code descriptor, written against version
2.1.273 as installed and its published hooks reference. Its hooks are the canonical
source in both modes; its standard output adds the result line, which only the output
reports. A descriptor records the version it was written against; the runner
reports that version and does not check the installed one.

## The local socket

`QORY_RUN_SOCKET` is an address, not a path to open: a path, or `unix:` and a path, is
the local socket, and any other scheme selects a transport, which a forwarder without it
refuses with an error that contains the scheme. The local socket is the only transport.
It is a Unix domain socket the runner creates before the runtime starts, in a private
directory of its own under the system's temporary directory, mode `0700`, because a
socket path has a short limit on some systems and a run directory in a deep checkout can
exceed it. A client connects, writes one record per line in the shape of
`record.schema.json`, and closes; the runner reads until end of file, one connection at
a time in the order they arrive, so two hook calls in a row keep their order. There is
no answer and no framing beyond the newline. The forwarder the runner installs as a hook
is one such client; a harness that reports something of its own writes the same shape
with `source: hooks`. Nothing on the socket reaches a receiver except through the
descriptor's rules. The socket is removed when the run ends.

## Images

The agent's image is the machine's to choose, and a run's to select among. The machine
defines images by name, and a run's policy selects one by that name, as it selects
credentials and tools; it contains no reference and defines no image, so a repository never
chooses what it runs under. A run whose policy selects none starts in the machine's
default. Images need a wall: without one the runtime is the machine's own process.

| Definition | Meaning |
|---|---|
| name | what a policy, or the machine's default, selects it by, in a credential's grammar |
| reference | the image, pinned by digest where the machine requires the same image every time |
| runtime | the container runtime the wall starts it under, one the machine's engine has: `sysbox-runc`. Absent is the engine's default |
| docker | the agent gets a Docker daemon of its own inside the enclosure (§The wall). It needs a runtime that runs one without privileges. Experimental |

```yaml
version: 1
egress:
  mode: enforce
  allow: [api.anthropic.com, registry-1.docker.io]
image: with-docker
```

The machine's default is the name of one of its images, or a reference, which starts
under the engine's default runtime with no daemon. A name the machine defines is read
as that image first.

**Refused before the run starts:** a name the machine does not define, a selection
without a wall, an image defined twice, a daemon without a runtime. The image a run
starts in is fixed when it starts: a run configuration that selects another is refused,
and the policy in force stays.

**The record.** `dev.qory.run.started` contains `image`, the reference, and when the image
is one the machine defines `image_name`, `container_runtime` when the definition sets
one, and `docker: true` when the enclosure has a daemon of its own.
`dev.qory.run.policy_applied` contains `image` when the policy selects one.

**What an image provides.** The wall builds no image and changes none. An image runs:

- under any user id the machine assigns it, with no home of its own: `HOME` points at a
  writable place;
- with its authorities in a bundle where the wall looks for one, so the run's
  certificate goes after them (§The wall);
- with the runtime at the path the launch sets;
- with no setuid program or capability needed for its work;
- for a Docker of the agent's own, with `dockerd` in `/usr/local/sbin`, `/usr/local/bin`,
  `/usr/sbin`, `/usr/bin`, `/sbin` or `/bin`, never looked for on the run's `PATH`, and
  the users and groups the wall passes it by name in its own `/etc/passwd` and
  `/etc/group`.

## The wall

A wall is what makes a connection around the proxy fail. It is optional: with none, the
runtime is a process of the machine and enforcement is cooperative (§Limits). With one,
the runtime runs in an **enclosure** and the session runner stays outside it with the
proxy, the policy and the server's secret; the record is written from outside, and the
enclosure sees the run directory read-only. A wall is built by an adapter, one per
container interface; the contract's rules refer to no specific tool and define one list
for all of them.

**What every wall guarantees:**

- no route out of the enclosure except to the session runner's proxy;
- a resolver that resolves nothing outside the enclosure;
- no cloud metadata address, which is a network path to credentials;
- no file of the host beyond the mounts the run lists, and no environment beyond what
  the run passes;
- a user that is not root, no added capabilities, no privileged mode, no host
  namespaces;
- no credential the run's policy selects: a placeholder where a program requires one set
  and the certificate of the run's authority, never a token and never the authority's
  key;
- never the container runtime's own socket: a process that can request a
  container on the host's network from the daemon has left the wall. A mount that is a
  socket, or a directory containing a runtime's, is refused.

When the run has an authority of its own (§Credentials), a wall sets the enclosure's
trust to one bundle, the image's own authorities with the run's certificate after them,
and points the variables programs read a bundle's path from at it: `SSL_CERT_FILE`,
`GIT_SSL_CAINFO`, `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`, `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`, `CURL_CA_BUNDLE` and
`AWS_CA_BUNDLE` unless the caller sets others. The bundle is the image's and one more,
never the run's alone, because those variables replace a program's trust and do not add
to it; an image that keeps a bundle nowhere known gets the run's alone and reaches only
the terminated hosts over TLS, which is the image's to mend. The authority's key never
crosses.

A run may set limits on what the agent uses, processors, memory, processes and the
size of `/dev/shm`; an adapter passes them to its engine and a run that sets none gets
the engine's defaults. They are no guarantee of the wall's: they keep one run from
starving a machine, not an agent inside.

The proxy is part of the list, because it dials from outside on behalf of what is
inside: behind a wall it is **guarded**, and what is on the runner's machine is not
reached by default. Two rules, in either mode, observe included:

- The link-local range, where a cloud keeps its metadata service, is refused whatever
  the allow list contains.
- The runner's own machine, loopback and every address it has, is refused unless an
  `egress.allow` entry of the policy lists the host itself. A `*.` suffix over it does
  not count, and neither does a name a harness declares under such a suffix: the
  machine's owner decides what is opened on the machine, a repository cannot. A
  local MCP server or model endpoint is reached through the proxy like everything else,
  decided and recorded, when the policy lists it, and the rule that lists it applies
  under observe as well. The session addresses such a server by the machine's host name or
  an alias of it, not by `localhost`, which `NO_PROXY` keeps inside the enclosure.

A refusal the proxy can make without resolving, a literal address or `localhost`, is a
`denied` `dev.qory.run.egress` with the rule `wall:own-address` and a `403`; a name that
resolves to such an address passes the decision, is refused when dialled, and the
runtime gets a `502`. Without the guard the way around a wall is through the proxy.

**What crosses**, all three the session runner's, none containing a credential of the
runner's: the proxy, as a network address; the pseudo-terminal or the pipes, through the
adapter's own command; the hook socket, as a mounted file where a file can cross.

**The relay.** The agent reaches the proxy by a name, through a relay: a process of the
runner's on the enclosure's network and on an ordinary one, listening on a fixed port and
copying every byte to one address fixed when it starts, the proxy's. It reads nothing,
decides nothing and takes no instruction from the agent; the policy stays in the session
runner. It exists because the host is not always where a container expects it: with
the engine in a virtual machine the network's gateway is the virtual machine's, not the
host's. It forwards no packet between its two networks: IP forwarding is off in its
namespace, so what it passes on is the connections it copies and nothing routed
through it.

**A Docker of the agent's own.** *Experimental.* Under the nested runtime the enclosure
has a root, and whether that root reaches the mounts the run lists as the machine's root
is unverified, so the option is experimental: it may change or be
withdrawn in a minor release, and a run that uses it mounts nothing the machine's root
must protect.

An image the machine defines with a daemon (§Images) provides the agent a Docker daemon
inside the enclosure, never the machine's. It needs a runtime that runs a daemon in a
container without privileges: `sysbox-runc`, whose container has a root of its own, in a
user namespace, mapped to a user of the machine's that is not root. The helper refuses
to start the daemon where the enclosure's root is the machine's, which it reads from
`/proc/self/uid_map`, so a runtime without a user namespace is no run. The enclosure
starts as that root, with no privileged mode and `no-new-privileges`, and with the whole
set of capabilities the runtime grants it inside its user namespace, which the daemon
needs; the wall's helper, not the image, starts it: `dockerd` on its Unix socket alone,
never a port of the enclosure's network, the socket in the agent's group, the daemon's
output in a file of its own; then, once the daemon answers, it drops every capability,
the bounding set included, becomes the agent's user, and clears the inheritable and
ambient sets. The daemon's store is a volume of the run's, removed with the enclosure,
with no size limit of the run's: the run's limits do not bound it. A daemon that exits
during the run is not started again, and its output is root's inside the enclosure, not
the agent's to read. Three guarantees read differently under it, and every other stands
as written:

- *no added capabilities*: the agent has none, and none to gain. The enclosure's root has
  every capability inside its user namespace, and nothing of the machine's;
- *not root*: the agent runs as a user that is not root. The enclosure has a root, a
  user of the machine's that is not root, and whoever reaches the daemon's socket is
  that root, inside the enclosure and nowhere else;
- *no file of the host beyond the mounts the run lists*: beyond those, and the
  runtime's own. Sysbox adds the machine's kernel modules, read-only, and scratch
  directories of its own, and shows emulated parts of `/proc` and `/sys`;
  `/proc/partitions` lists the machine's disks, none of which opens.

The containers the agent starts are inside the enclosure's network namespace, a
container on the host's network or a privileged one included, so they reach the relay
and nothing else, and what they reach is decided and recorded as the agent's own
traffic. The daemon pulls through the proxy, so a registry is a host the policy allows.
Those containers do not resolve the relay's name: the agent's docker configuration,
`DOCKER_CONFIG` at `/run/qory/docker` unless the run sets one, sets the proxy for them
by its address. They do not get the run's bundle unless the agent mounts it into them, and
they inherit `no-new-privileges`, so a setuid program in them gains nothing. Docker in
Docker with `--privileged`, and the machine's own socket, stay refused. gVisor breaks
the list: its daemon inside starts only with every capability added.

**One conformance suite**, the `wall/walltest` package, checks the list from inside the
enclosure with a real session behind the adapter, and an adapter ships when the suite
passes for it. The suite needs Linux and the tool, so it runs in the runner's CI on a
Linux machine; the ordinary tests compare the commands an adapter generates with golden
files and need neither.

**What ships:** `docker`, through the `docker` command and no library, serving whatever
engine that command reaches. It is supported where the suite passes. An engine in a
virtual machine on a Mac is where a wall is developed, not a target: the suite passes
there without the hook check (§Limits). The agent's image is the caller's; the wall
builds none. A Docker of the agent's own is experimental, under `sysbox-runc`, where the
suite passes with it: the runner's CI installs Sysbox on a Linux machine and runs the
suite in an enclosure with a daemon. The suite checks the list as the agent's user; what
the enclosure's root reaches of the mounts the run lists is the open question that keeps
the option experimental.
